Meta’s mixed-reality attempt at a Wii Sports knockoff is coming,"A new game called Home Sports is set to release on the Meta Quest 3 and 3S on December 11th, priced at $19.99, and aims to be the mixed reality equivalent of Wii Sports.

It adapts to your play space and supports the Quest boundaryless mode for larger areas.

"Meta could outdo Google in the AI transformation, professor says","Despite being a pioneer in artificial intelligence research, Google is not expected to benefit significantly from the AI transformation, according to Howard Yu, a professor at IMD Business School. Yu argues that Google's core business model, which relies on simple search and link-clicking, is being undermined by AI advancements, while Meta's advertising ecosystem is being enhanced by AI. Meta has successfully adapted its AI-powered advertising system to changes like Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature and is integrating AI to blur the lines between content and advertising. Additionally, Meta's partnership with EssilorLuxottica on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses provides an AI advantage without threatening its business model. In contrast, Google struggles to integrate AI into its products without jeopardizing its search business, as AI chatbots can provide direct answers, reducing the need for users to click on ad-generating links.",2024-11-25,0.7966825427487493,0.0034644546278286724,0.19985299728577957
