        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTesla could benefit from any removal of consumer tax credits on electric-vehicle purchases.\n\nThe move could hurt competitors more, CEO Elon Musk said.\n\nAnd Tesla wants to keep its strong lead in the US EV market.\n\nElon Musk supports a plan from President-elect Donald Trump to end tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-vehicle purchases.\n\nThat might sound confusing: Why would the CEO of Tesla want to end a program that makes it cheaper for people to buy EVs?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, Musk said, it would devastate Tesla's rivals. And Tesla wants to keep its strong lead in the US EV market, which recently slipped under 50% for the first time.\n\n\"I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly,\" Musk said in a July earnings call, predicting the impact of the tax credits ending. \"But long-term probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Reuters reported Trump planned to end the EV tax credit, with support from Tesla representatives. In a related post on X, Musk said: \"End all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla has had a longer time than some of its rivals to benefit from government subsidies. Its market lead is well established, and it has led an EV pricing war that has squeezed its rivals, making it harder for them to survive if consumer demand falls even further.\n\nPut simply: Tesla wins if ending the tax credit pressures smaller rivals enough to stall their growth or even fold.\n\nRelated stories\n\nTesla sells more EVs than anyone else, and more profitably\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Tesla reported a pretax profit margin of 18%, well above the industry average of about 9%. Ford, the only competitor to break out its EV-specific finances, reported a minus 104% margin for its Model E unit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet many of Tesla's vehicles are also priced well below many competitors'. The Model 3 starts at $42,490 (after a cheaper option disappeared earlier this year). That's well below the average EV price in the US, which held steady at nearly $57,000 in October, according to Kelley Blue Book data.\n\nIn an effort to juice sales, Tesla has drastically cut prices on many of its cars over the past year, instigating an industrywide price war that has cut into its own margin in pursuit of maintaining its industry-leading market share. Of the nearly 600,000 EVs sold in the US in the first half of 2023, half were made by Tesla. Ford, in second place, accounted for just over 7% of EVs sold in the same period.\n\n\"While losing the EV tax credit could also hurt some demand on the margins in the US, this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples to oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears,\" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime Tesla bull, told clients in a note on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla is ahead of the curve in building a US manufacturing presence\n\nEliminating the consumer tax credit, part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, would need congressional approval. It's not yet clear if Trump and the incoming Republican-controlled Congress would target other tax incentives from the legislation, like those supporting domestic manufacturing of cars, batteries, and other components. Competitors like BMW, Honda, and Hyundai have raced to scale up factories stateside to take advantage of those credits.\n\nTesla has been ahead of this curve in manufacturing, too, with six US factories churning out cars and batteries. That work has paid off, and many Tesla models are regularly named as the most \"American-made\" compared with competitors, many of which rely on factories in Mexico. In fact, only one other American automaker even cracked the top 10 in 2024.\n\nTesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said in a July earnings call that the company had taken advantage of manufacturing credits but added: \"We always drive ourselves to say, OK, what if there is no IRA benefit? And how do we operate in that kind of an environment? Like Elon said, we definitely have a big advantage as compared to our competition on that front.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group representing Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota, and others, urged Congress to keep the tax credits.\n\nThe tax credits, including those for commercial leasing and manufacturing, are \"critical to cementing the US as a global leader in the future of automotive technology and manufacturing,\" it said in an October letter to Congress published by Politico.\n\nThe group, which does not include Tesla, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Musk supports cutting the EV tax credit, reports of its potential demise appear to have spooked investors. Tesla shares fell about 5% following the Reuters report, while Rivian shares fell 11%.\n\nMusk and other Tesla leaders have long said autonomous vehicles are the future of Tesla, not just EVs, and encouraged prospective investors to think much more long-term.\n\nCorrection — November 15, 2024: An earlier version of this story overstated Tesla's market share. It sold about 50% of all EVs in the US in the first half of 2024, not the vast majority."

        "content": "Tesla has announced that it will finally deliver 500 kW charging as it is about to install its long-awaited V4 Supercharger cabinets.\n\nThe rollout of Supercharger V4 has been a strange one, to say the least.\n\nTesla has been deploying the new charging stations for two years and calling them “Supercharger V4”, but it has only been deploying the charging stalls.\n\nSupercharger stations are made of two main parts: the stalls, which are where the charging cable is located, and the cabinets, which are generally located further back and include all the power electronics.\n\nFor all these new “Supercharger V4”, Tesla was actually using Supercharger V3 cabinets. This has been limiting the power output of the charging stations to 250 kW – although\n\nToday, Tesla officially announced its “V4 Cabinet”, which the automaker claims will enable of “delivering up to 500kW for cars and 1.2MW for Semi.”\n\nHere are the main features of the V4 Cabinet as per Tesla:\n\nFaster charging: Supports 400V-1000V vehicle architectures, including 30% faster charging for Cybertruck. S3XY vehicles enjoy 250kW charge rates they already experience on V3 Cabinet — charging up to 200 miles in 15 minutes.\n\nSupports 400V-1000V vehicle architectures, including 30% faster charging for Cybertruck.

Lower footprint and complexity = more sites coming online faster.\n\nV4 Cabinet powers 8 posts, 2X the stalls per cabinet. Lower footprint and complexity = more sites coming online faster. Next-generation hardware: Cutting-edge power electronics designed to be the most reliable on the planet, with 3X power density enabling higher throughput with lower costs.\n\nTesla reports that its first sites with the new V4 Cabinets are going into permitting now. The company expects its first sites to open next year.\n\nWe recently reported about Tesla’s new Oasis Supercharger project, which includes larger solar arrays and battery packs to operate the charging station mostly off-grid.\n\nEarly in the deployment of the Supercharger network, Tesla promised to add solar arrays and batteries to all Supercharger stations, and Musk even said that most stations would be able to operate off-grid.\n\nWhile Tesla did add solar and batteries to a few stations, the vast majority of them don’t have their own power system or have only minimal solar canopies.\n\nBack in 2016, I asked Musk about this, and he said that it would now happen as Tesla had the “pieces now in place” with Supercharger V3, Powerpack V2, and SolarCity:\n\nIt took about 8 years, but it sounds like the pieces are now getting actually in place with Supercharger V4, Megapacks, and this new Oasis project."

We need super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting,” DOGE continued, calling on those individuals to DM them their CV and promising that “Elon & Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants”:\n\nTrump made the historic announcement this week, stating, “I am pleased to announce that the Great Elon Musk, working in conjunction with American Patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency (‘DOGE’).”\n\n“Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies — Essential to the ‘Save America’ Movement,” Trump added:\n\n“Over the last decade, Congress has gradually (and lazily) ceded its lawmaking power to a bureaucratic machine that now churns out 90,000 pages of regulations per year,” Ramaswamy said on X, sharing a video of himself explaining that reforming the bureaucracy is a myth. “Time to unplug the printer”:\n\nRep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) spoke about DOGE during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily on Thursday, noting that “they can get rid of the bureaucrats, for sure.”\n\n“There’s certainly things that they can do on that front. But you know, as an example, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency. Congress created the Department of Education. Nothing says that they have to have 4,500 employees at the Department of Education,” he added."

        "content": "The Tesla Cybertruck is closing in on an average of a recall every two months this year, as it notified the NHTSA last week of a sixth fix that can't be software patched away.\n\nTesla has informed [PDF] the NHTSA of its sixth recall of the year on Musk's steel behemoth, this time due to faulty components in the vehicle's drive inverter used to control torque in the truck's electric motors.\n\nAccording to the recall notice, faulty metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET) in the inverters of Cybertrucks manufactured between November 6, 2023 and July 30, 2024 (2,431 of them, per NHTSA documents) can cause affected vehicles to suddenly lose torque, leading to a loss of propulsion.\n\nTesla believes only 1 percent of the total vehicle population includes faulty MOSFETs, but everyone with a vehicle manufactured in the covered period will need to bring it in to get a new drive inverter. Whether you do so at full speed, in limp mode or on the back of a tow truck is your own prerogative.\n\nThe automaker said it will begin offering replacements next month, but doesn't intend to notify owners of the problem or remedy until January.\n\nTesla also noted in its recall report that improved drive inverters were included in Cybertrucks manufactured on or after July 30, though it's not clear what prompted the inverter replacement or whether Tesla was aware of a faulty component that, in its own words, \"may increase the risk of a collision.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to questions for this story.\n\n\"No warning occurs prior to the loss of propulsion,\" Tesla said in its recall report to the NHTSA. \"However, when the driver loses the ability to apply torque, they will immediately receive a visual alert on the user interface, with an instruction to safely pull over the vehicle to the side of the road.\"\n\nTesla said it began investigating the issue in August after a customer complaint of a sudden loss of propulsion in late July. The EV maker said that it took until October to identify \"an increased rate of failure for a population of drive inverters equipped with MOSFET components.\" Tesla said it was aware of five warranty claims related to the issue, but that there were no known collisions, injuries or fatalities associated with the issue.\n\nAs we've noted in numerous stories since the Cybertruck came lurching onto American roads in November 2023, the vehicle has been recalled five other times since January, though two of those officially named \"recalls\" were able to be resolved with software updates to fix the rear camera issues and difficult-to-read fonts on the dashboard.\n\nThe other three, however, have been physical fixes, with the Cybertruck recalled twice in June over failing windshield wiper motors and self-detaching trim and in April for faulty accelerator pedal covers that slipped and lodged themselves under the footwell, causing unintended acceleration.\n\nAccording to vehicle recall data analysis, Teslas are some of the most recalled vehicles on the road, with Models Y, 3, S, and X taking up four of the top seven spots on a list of vehicles with the most safety recalls. The Cybertruck, being as new as it is, isn't on the list yet – but it probably will be soon enough. ®"

        "content": "By Carolina Mandl\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Hedge funds piled into bets on financial stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) shares and a prison operator in the third quarter, filings showed, ahead of a rally that followed Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nMany of the bets have become known as so-called Trump trades, corners of the market that at times were swayed by the Republican candidate's fortunes before the election and notched gains after his win.\n\nBridgewater Associates, Coatue Management and D1 Capital were among those that added shares of banks and other financial stocks, which have soared since election day on hopes that a Trump win would bring looser regulations to the financial industry, according to filings released Thursday.\n\nBridgewater, founded by Ray Dalio, ended September with bigger positions in Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE: ) and Citigroup (NYSE: ). It also built a new position in Bank of America.\n\nThe fund's biggest position in dollar terms was Wells Fargo, a stake worth $79.6 million at the end of September.\n\nThe Index is up roughly 17% since the end of September and has surged by nearly 12% since the Nov. 5 vote.\n\nIt is not possible to say whether Bridgewater and the other funds held their positions past Sept. 30, which is the cutoff date for the 13-F filings. Though they are backward-looking, the filings are one of the few ways to see the portfolios of often-secretive market players such as hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds.\n\nOther hedge funds making bets on the banking sector included Dan Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners (WA: ), which had a new $174.9 million stake in Bank of America on Sept. 30, a filing showed.\n\nCoatue Management reduced its sizable stakes in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), but built new stakes in two investment firms.

        "publish_date": "2024-11-14T20:33:00Z",
        "content": "In November 2024, videos surfaced on social media alleging that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had purchased Ford, one of the biggest names in the American automotive industry, without any evidence to corroborate the claim. The assertion was unfounded.\n\nIt was not the first time unfounded rumors about Musk acquiring Ford had spread on YouTube. Snopes found several videos dating back to June 2023 alleging that Musk had purchased the brand. These videos all appeared with titles like \"Elon Musk OFFICIALLY bought Ford! | HUGE NEWS!\" Artificial intelligence (AI) video-creation tools seemingly helped create some of the video's narration, scripting, and sequencing.\n\nAs an example, one video's narrator said:\n\n\"Did you know that Ford produces a new F-150 truck every 52 seconds? Now imagine that speed combined with Tesla's cutting-edge EV technology. That's the future Elon Musk is betting on with his shocking acquisition of Ford.\"\n\nThat YouTube video had been viewed more than 20,000 times, as of this writing, since its upload on Oct. 30, 2024. Other videos on the same topic had over 300,000 views. Posts on social media sites like X shared the claim and linked to dubious news articles sharing the same content as \"proof.\"\n\nBut there was no evidence to support the assertion that Musk had bought Ford. If, hypothetically speaking, there was even a sliver of truth to the claim — for instance, if Musk had announced a partnership with Ford that allowed its electric vehicles to use Tesla Superchargers — reputable business and automotive media outlets would have interviewed parties involved and documented the ordeal. That had not happened.\n\nIn short, the claim appeared to be made up from whole cloth for the purpose of gaining clicks, or views, online. A disclaimer at the bottom of one YouTube video read: \"Disclaimer: This video is based on rumors and fiction.\"\n\nMusk's status has made him a prominent target of misleading rumors. For example, we previously debunked the false claim that the billionaire had bought Walt Disney World or CNN."

        "content": "Tesla reportedly supports the Trump administration’s plan to kill the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles – something in direct contradiction to Tesla’s original mission to accelerate the entire industry’s transition to electric transport.\n\nElon Musk, who has both financed and “fully endorsed” Donald Trump, has walked back much of his prior messaging around the need to accelerate the transport and energy sector’s transition to sustainability to address climate change.\n\nIn fact, during Trump’s prior administration, Musk was part of his “business council”, but he resigned after Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nMusk has now made it clear that he believes the “woke mind virus” is a bigger threat to humanity than climate change.\n\nThe CEO even supported Trump when he said he plans to remove the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles once he is back in power. That’s despite Tesla having lobbied for the credit. The incentive has been supporting Tesla’s sales in the US over the last few years.\n\nMusk even laid out a scenario where removing the tax credit would hurt Tesla, but he believes it would hurt other automakers more – removing some of the competition. That’s a direct contradiction to what Musk has said many times in the past, which is to encourage the entire auto industry to go electric.\n\nEven more recently, the CEO has complained that the main problem with EV adoption is the cost being to high – something that the tax credit is directly addressing in the US.\n\nTesla now supports removing the tax credit\n\nThese days, it’s hard to separate Musk and Tesla. Even though he is technically only CEO and minority shareholder, it is widely believed that he controls the board, and, therefore, he is able to do anything unchecked at Tesla.\n\nThis is actually what led to the judge’s decision in his CEO compensation case earlier this year.\n\nNow, Musk’s position on the tax credit that Tesla lobbied hard for is also Tesla’s position.\n\nAccording to a new Reuters report, Trump’s transition team is reportedly already strategizing about how to remove the EV tax credit:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe report states the energy transition team is led by Harold Hamm, an oil billionaire, but that they have consulted with Tesla, which is reportedly backing the move:\n\nEnding the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling U.S. EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla – by far the nation’s largest EV seller – have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Trump administration would have to get Congress’s approval to remove the EV incentive.\n\nElectrek’s Take\n\nLike I wrote in my post about selling my Tesla position, the main reason I can’t be involved with Tesla anymore is that it is moving away from its mission.\n\nThere’s no better example than this.\n\nElon is willing to slow down the entire US EV industry as long as Tesla can come out on top in the next few years.\n\nA source familiar with Tesla’s policy team suggested that it could be a negotiating strategy. Tesla may know it can’t save the tax credit so it is agreeing with Trump in order to have a bit more credibility on other matters, like the battery production credits that Tesla has been enjoying under Biden’s IRA.\n\nBut that could be a stretch, and in my opinion, it is not worth supporting something that will undoubtedly result in lower EV sales in the US, a country already way behind the rest of the world in EV adoption.\n\nAlso, it’s fair to note that this move should help Tesla in Q4 as the threat of removing the tax credit is resulted in surges in sales in the past to take advantage of it before it goes away.\n\nIt comes as Tesla is trying to achieve record sales in Q4 in order not to be down in deliveries for the entire year."

And yet representatives of Tesla – by far the nation’s largest EV seller – have told a Trump transition committee that they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump’s biggest backers and the world’s richest person, said earlier this year that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales, but would devastate its US EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors.\n\nShares of Tesla fell 5.5 percent to $311.77 in afternoon trading on Thursday.\n\nRepealing the subsidy, which has been a signature measure of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said.\n\nThe group has had several meetings since Trump’s November 5 election victory, including some at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where Musk has also spent considerable time since the election.\n\nRepresentatives of Tesla, GM, Ford, Stellantis and the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing nearly all major automakers besides Tesla, also did not immediately respond. The alliance last month in an October 15 letter urged the US Congress to retain EV tax credits, calling them “critical to cementing the US as a global leader in the future of automotive technology and manufacturing.”\n\nTrump repeatedly pledged to end Biden’s “EV mandate” on the campaign trail, without spelling out specific targeted policies.\n\nThe energy-focused transition team has determined that some of the clean-energy policies in Biden’s IRA will be tough to roll back given that the programmes have already started allocating money, including to Republican-dominated states where the programmes are popular, the sources said.\n\nTrump’s energy transition team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress as part of a larger tax-reform bill.\n\nTrump needs the cost savings from killing the credit to help pay for the extension of his trillions of dollars in tax cuts that are set to expire early in his term, the two sources said. Congressional Republicans are set to take up the broader tax measure as one of their first actions.\n\nMembers of the energy transition team expect the Republican-controlled Congress will deploy a legislative measure known as reconciliation to avoid relying on Democratic votes. Biden used the same tactic to get the IRA bill passed.\n\nKilling EV tax credits is strongly supported by Hamm, a longtime Trump supporter, along with most of the broader oil-and-gas industry.\n\nThe president-elect promised before the election to boost US oil production even as it has hit record highs and to roll back Biden’s costly clean energy initiatives, which, in addition to the EV credit, include subsidies for wind and solar power and the mass production of hydrogen.\n\nHurt rising competition\n\nTesla has over the years been the biggest beneficiary of EV tax credits like the one in Biden’s IRA legislation, along with similar credits that preceded it. And yet it now may stand to gain from killing the subsidy because that could hurt rising EV competitors more than Tesla.\n\nMusk himself pointed out as much in a July earnings call when asked about the possibility of losing the subsidy, along with battery-production tax credits, under a Trump administration.\n\nTesla had a market share of just under half of all electric vehicles sold in the third quarter of this year, according to data from Cox Automotive. Other automakers with notable US EV sales such as GM, Ford and Hyundai individually trail far behind. But Tesla’s US EV rivals collectively have in recent years steadily eroded its market share, which exceeded 80 percent in the first quarter of 2020."

It’s already the case in all widely released versions of (Supervised) Full Self-Driving (FSD) for city driving, but not for highway driving, which uses another software stack.\n\nTesla originally planned to deliver it for highway driving in October, but it was only delivered to a small number of vehicles.\n\nIn its latest AI roadmap, Tesla said that it would come the first week of November instead.\n\nNow, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla’s head of self-driving and AI, said that the latest release with end-to-end highway driving (v12.5.6.3) has been widely pushed to HW4 vehicle owners:\n\nWith the latest release (v12.5.6.3), FSD is using end-to-end neural networks for driving across highways, city streets and parking lots, and has now shipped widely for AI4 vehicles. Highway driving should be smoother, more natural and even safer than the previous explicit control stack. Check out the different driving styles to set speed and lane change preferences. Enjoy and let Tesla AI know if you have any feedback.\n\nHowever, there’s no word for the millions of HW3 vehicle owners.\n\nIn fact, the only thing promised to HW3 vehicles, which Tesla now called AI3, in its last roadmap is this:\n\nImproved v12.5.x models for AI3 city driving\n\nAs we have often reported this year, Tesla has reached the limits of the HW3 computer and now needs to optimize the code with every release despite still being far from its promise of unsupervised self-driving.\n\nElectrek’s Take\n\nThis is annoying cause I could really use end-to-end on my HW3 car. I am on v12.5.4.2 and it has been a regression from v12.5.4.1 for me, especially on highways.\n\nYesterday, it almost drove me off-road when taking my highway exit, which is always a bit shaky because it is a short exit and FSD often swings itself into it. It’s a bit awkward, and my girlfriend never likes it, so I disengage FSD before taking the exit when she was with me, but this time, she wasn’t, and I had the new update.\n\nIt again swung left before going right into the exit, but this time, it went way too far, and I was in the shoulder by the time I took control.\n\nI took this exit hundreds of times with FSD and it’s the first time it did that.\n\nI am starting to think we won’t see much more improvements to FSD with HW3 cars and there’s no retrofit computer in sight."

Having access to whatever apps I want instead of waiting for Tesla to implement them, such as I had to do with YouTube Music, would be beneficial. This is what Teslogic is trying to accomplish with its Kickstarter campaign for Screenmate.\n\nAlready having reached its $500,000 goal within a week of going live, Screenmate is an Android-powered box that you’ll hook up to your Tesla, integrating Tesla’s systems into an Android interface with all of the Android capabilities you’d expect. For example, you can download and use any app you want from Google Play, but still have access to all of your Tesla controls. Not only that, but Teslogic claims you’ll gain controls via its reworked control panel.\n\nFor example, you can adjust the passenger seat or even open the passenger door from this panel, which are options apparently not already provided by Tesla. The big highlight is downloading and using whatever apps you want. Teslogic shows off fullscreen Waze and multi-window support, but also the gaming possibilities are upped entirely with access to Xbox and PlayStation’s cloud gaming services, complete with controller support.\n\nAs for the tech that powers all of this, Teslogic explains that inside the black box, “there are modules designed for video streams, touchscreen data, and the vehicle’s CAN buses, all powered by a modern Android computer utilizing a Qualcomm chipset. Each module supports software updates, ensuring new features and compatibility with future Tesla updates.” The chipset they refer to is a Snapdragon 680 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.\n\nInstallation looks simple enough too, with the user only needing to plug in a couple of wires that go to the Tesla MCU and Diagnostic Connector. Total installation time is said to be roughly 10 minutes then you’re up and running.\n\nIf you want to get this is in your own Tesla, the current price is $599, which is 33% off what the expected MSRP will be. Estimated delivery is May, 2025, but again, the project is already fully funded, so hopefully the creators are able to ship without any issues. Stretch goals are being discussed, with additional features getting teased.\n\nIf I drove my wife’s Tesla more, I’d certainly consider this, simply for accessing whatever Android app I want. That would be very enjoyable.\n\nUpdate: The folks behind this campaign have introduced a new feature after passing $700,000 in funding. Good work, people. The new feature will allow for your Tesla’s blind spot camera to wirelessly beam to your mounted smartphone for easier viewing. That could be sweet.\n\nAlso, they have posted live videos of the technology in action. It looks fast and super responsive, so that’s encouraging. This campaign won’t be live much longer, so if interested, follow the link below."

        "content": "On this week’s episode of Decoder, we’re talking about Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Tesla — and I have to say, it feels like the first of many episodes about these three characters that we’ll be doing over the course of the next four years.\n\nMusk’s efforts to get Trump elected president in 2024 will go down in history as the ultimate money-in-politics story. He dumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the race, used his platform X to relentlessly promote Trump, and promised to run a government efficiency commission that would radically reshape how America operates if any of his ideas get put into action.\n\nSince the election, Musk has been deep in the mix planning Trump’s second term: he reportedly spent time at Mar-a-Lago, weighing in on cabinet appointments and even hopping on the phone with world leaders like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also attended Trump’s first postelection meeting with House Republicans in Washington, DC, this week.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, Trump announced that Elon would co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Yes, the acronym is DOGE. Yes, the efficiency initiative has redundant leadership. And to be clear: this is not a real department or government agency — only Congress can create those. But it looks like Elon’s ambitions to “dismantle federal bureaucracy” with severe budget cuts and layoffs have landed him a real advisory job and a direct line to Trump.\n\nBut there’s one big problem in all of this: Elon’s money all comes from Tesla, and in particular, Tesla’s enormously overvalued stock price. Tesla is already the leading seller of EVs in America, but to keep things going, Musk has to sell more electric cars and also deliver on the promise of those cars becoming self-driving robotaxis. The problem is that Trump turned EVs and the EV transition into a political nightmare during the election — not to mention climate change overall, which Trump has resolutely denied.\n\nSo how is the CEO of an electric car company, an outspoken advocate for combating climate change, going to square his support for Trump and a Republican policy agenda centered on climate change denial? Can Musk convince Trump to pump the brakes on gutting climate regulations and the EV transition, or is he just looking to spare Tesla as best he can and give it an edge over the competition?\n\nI invited Andy Hawkins, Verge transportation editor and resident Elon Musk expert, on the show to make sense of what could happen next. And it couldn’t be a more critical moment for the auto industry, which has been trying to transition to EVs and taking in billions in incentives and funding from the Biden administration to speed up the process.\n\nA Trump agenda dead set on slowing EV adoption could be a disaster not just for Tesla but also for every other US automaker, too. Throw in Trump’s controversial tariff plan, and well… you have a political and economic mess of unprecedented proportions that could shape the auto industry in America for years to come.\n\nIf you’d like to read more and keep up with the fast-moving Musk-Trump news cycle, here are some stories we discussed:\n\nWhat does Trump’s election mean for EVs, Tesla, and Elon Musk? | The Verge\n\nThis election will decide what kind of car you’ll buy | The Verge\n\nTrump says Musk will lead ‘DOGE’ office to cut ‘wasteful’ government spending | The Verge\n\nElon Musk attends Trump’s first postelection meeting with House Republicans | CNBC\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, ‘Uncle’ Elon Musk puts his imprint on the Trump transition | NYT\n\nMusk believes in global warming.

PT raised to $300 on higher earnings and growth, and lower discount rate.\"\n\nToday's note from Jefferies echoes that of Bank of America from last week, wherein BofA analysts admitted that Tesla might see potential upside going forward vis-à-vis \"the federal regulation of autonomous vehicles and FSD, which aligns with Elon Musk’s push for a national standard for self-driving.\"\n\nSimilarly, earlier this week, Wedbush's Dan Ives raised his target for Tesla shares by $100 per share to $400, arguing that the \"Trump White House win will be a game changer for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years.\""

        "description": "You have more home battery options than just the Tesla Powerwall, but know these things before buying.",
        "link": "https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/the-5-most-important-things-to-look-for-in-a-home-battery/",
        "publish_date": "2024-11-14T18:03:01Z",
        "content": "Shopping for a home battery isn't like shopping for a refrigerator, oven or washer and dryer set. Home batteries are a mix of complex hardware and software that becomes directly wired into your home's main electrical system -- they aren't appliances you can just plug in.\n\nYou can't just visit your local hardware store and compare all your options on the show floor. Instead, you'll need to contact local installers in your area and have them provide a quote for your home. And if you decide to pair a home battery with a solar panel system, you'll need to find an installer who's qualified to handle both. A reputable installer will walk you through everything you need to know about your home battery system, but it doesn't hurt to brush up on some key specs and terminology before speaking with a professional. Not only will it make the conversation easier to digest, but knowing the vocabulary can also help you to better compare your options.\n\nHome batteries are an expensive home upgrade and there are many factors that go into what makes a home battery a \"good battery.\" And the truth is, while there's certainly a most popular battery (the Tesla Powerwall), there's not even truly a \"best battery,\" as the best battery is the battery that best suits your energy needs and budget. However, there are still some fundamentals to know about what makes a good home battery. After more than a year of covering home batteries, I've got a few of these basics nailed down. These are some of my home battery must-knows to help you sort through your options.\n\nCan solar panels save you money? Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we’ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.\n\nEnergy storage capacity\n\nIf you only know one thing about your home battery, please at least know its energy storage capacity. It's the amount of energy the battery is able to store, typically measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). You can usually find a battery's capacity rating at the top of its spec sheet and probably in its marketing materials too. The higher the number, the more energy it can stash away.\n\nBut just because a battery has a high capacity rating doesn't always mean it's your best option. What you should really concern yourself with is finding the right size battery for your household's energy needs. If you have a small house with few power-hungry appliances, you probably don't need a giant 30 kWh battery. And if you have a large house, a small 5 kWh battery probably isn't going to keep your home up and running for very long during an outage. Your installer should be able to walk you through the recommended energy storage capacity for your home.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are two types of capacity ratings to look for on a home battery's spec sheet: maximum (or rated) capacity and usable capacity. Maximum capacity is the total amount of energy the battery is able to store. Usable capacity is the amount of energy that's available for you to use and is the more important number of the two to pay attention to.\n\nAnd while not having access to all of your battery's capacity sounds bad, it's actually for the benefit of your battery's health and lifespan in most cases. One of the main reasons manufacturers will block off capacity is so that the battery never fully drains to zero. Letting your battery reach zero isn't good for its long-term health. Sectioning off some of the capacity ensures your battery will never actually reach zero.\n\nConsidering Solar Panels? Our email course will walk you through how to go solar\n\nPower rating\n\nAnother important spec to pay attention to is a battery's power rating, which is the amount of power your battery is able to handle, typically measured in kilowatts (kW). It's what determines how much of your home you're able to provide backup power to at any given moment. Think of it as your battery's capacity for how many circuits you can supply backup power to. The higher the number, the more of your home you'll be able to back up. These numbers are often dependent on the capabilities of the inverter, which converts the DC electricity stored in your battery into AC electricity that your appliances can use.\n\nHome batteries come with two types of power ratings: Maximum rated (or peak) power and rated continuous power. Peak power is used to describe how the maximum amount of power the battery system is able to handle for a short time and is usually double the system's continuous power rating. But don't get too excited. That peak power only lasts for under a minute at a time and is mainly used to kick start power-hungry appliances, like your HVAC system.\n\nConsidering Solar Panels? Our email course will walk you through how to go solar\n\nWhat you really want to pay attention to is the battery's continuous power rating. This will tell you how much of your home your battery will be able to supply power to at all times. Expect this number to be quite a bit lower than the maximum rating. The good news is that home battery and inverter technology have evolved quite a bit within a short period of time. Most of the newer home batteries I've seen on today's market come with at least 9 kW of continuous power versus the average 5 kW of continuous power that most older battery models have.\n\nThe Tesla Powerwall, the most popular home battery, had a major power upgrade between product generations. The Powerwall 3 comes with an 11.5 kW continuous power rating, more than doubling the continuous rated power of the Powerwall 2 (5 kW).\n\nLifespan and warranty\n\nEvery home battery comes with a warranty, but not all of them are as great as they sound. There are three main components of your battery's warranty: years, cycles/throughput and some sort of capacity guarantee. Out of all three, the cycle/throughput clause is the most important. Here's a quick breakdown of what all this means:\n\nYears: This is the amount of time your warranty is good for. Most battery warranties last for 10 years. Some batteries will come with a 12 or even a 15-year warranty, but those aren't as common. Don't get too excited. There are all sorts of clauses and exceptions inside the fine print that can end your warranty much earlier. Using your battery more than what the manufacturer listed on the warranty and performing maintenance on the system without a certified installer present are just a few examples.\n\nCycles: Cycles (and throughput) are the most important things to look for in your warranty. Every time you drain and recharge your battery, it completes a cycle. Manufacturers will warrant your battery for a designated amount of cycles, which is essentially its estimated lifespan. In most cases, once your battery surpasses its warranted cycle count, your warranty will expire, even if you haven't hit the 10-year mark. The higher the cycle count, the longer its estimated lifespan. The average battery warranty will be good for somewhere between 6,000 and 8,000 cycles, but there are batteries out there that will last much longer.\n\nThroughput: Just like cycles, your battery's warranted energy throughput is another way the manufacturer estimates battery lifespan. The listed throughput on the warranty is the total amount of energy the manufacturer expects the battery to deliver during its lifetime, measured in megawatt hours (MWh). Once your battery delivers the listed throughput, your warranty expires.\n\nCapacity guarantee: Your battery's total capacity will depreciate over time. To help compensate for this degradation, most warranties will include some sort of end-of-warranty capacity guarantee. This is essentially the manufacturer's promise that your battery's original total capacity won't depreciate past a certain amount by the time your warranty expires. Most home batteries come with a 70% capacity guarantee, but there are others that might guarantee up to 80% or higher.\n\nModularity\n\nMany battery manufacturers have adopted modular designs for their newer home battery systems. Think of these modules as building blocks. Instead of one giant battery, a modular battery system is a bunch of smaller batteries connected together to share total capacity. If you combined three 5-kWh battery modules together, you'd get a total energy storage capacity of 15 kWh.\n\nThe biggest advantage modular systems bring to the table is that they offer customizable and expandable energy storage. Maybe you don't need a giant 15 kWh battery, or maybe there isn't enough room in your budget for that large of a battery at this time. With a modular system, you're able to start small and upgrade your energy storage capacity as your energy needs evolve. You won't need to buy another giant battery. However, if you reach the maximum allowed capacity on one system, you'll have to buy another.\n\nManufacturers and installers like modular systems because they tend to be easier to install. It's a lot easier to carry in several smaller batteries than it is to lug around a single giant 300-pound battery. Modular systems also tend to be easier to repair. If something goes wrong with the battery in a non-modular system, the system might shut down and the whole thing might need to be replaced. Things get a bit easier with a modular system. If something goes wrong with a battery module, it's not going to shut down the entire system. In most cases, the installer will just need to replace the broken module versus the entire system.\n\nHow the battery is priced\n\nThis is where things get a bit tricky. Home batteries are a site-dependent purchase, meaning the all-in costs will look a bit different depending on where the system is installed. Every home is different, so a home battery estimate for your house is going to look a bit different than one for your neighbor's house.\n\nThe good news is the cost of home batteries has gone down within the past few years. The bad news is that they're still extremely expensive. There are all sorts of costs associated with home batteries: the battery itself, additional components, installation and taxes. The most expensive thing by far is the battery itself, often costing $10,000 or more. The rest of the costs are likely going to fall somewhere between $1,500 and $5,000, or more.\n\nTo get the most accurate pricing estimate, you'll need to speak with an installer. However, you can get a sort of ballpark estimate on your own by working out the battery's cost per kWh. Most home batteries on today's market typically cost between $1,000 and $2,000 per kWh of energy storage. The Tesla Powerwall, for example, is currently selling for around $1,000 per kWh, according to a report from EnergySage. And since the Tesla Powerwall is a 13.5 kWh battery, you're looking at about $13,500 for the cost of the battery itself. The additional system costs and installation are likely going to cost additional thousands.\n\nWe were quoted $16,551 for the all-in cost of installing a Tesla Powerwall 3 on a South Carolina home from Tesla's website. That's not too terrible, all things considered. It's also worth noting that this estimate doesn't include any federal, state or local financial incentives. The Residential Clean Energy Credit alone could take up to 30% off the total cost of a home battery installation."

        "content": "The reasoning behind Elon Musk’s decision to heavily back former (and future) President Donald Trump as well as be the “first buddy” is becoming more clear now. The Trump Administration is set to take over about 80 federal vehicle issue probes that were opened under President Joe Biden. One of those probes just happens to be the massive National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software. I have all the confidence in the world this will go well.\n\nIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video It's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions\n\nIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish It's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions\n\nUnder Biden, NHTSA has been examining if FSD can safely operate in fog, dust, glare and other reduced visibility conditions, according to Bloomberg. The probe was brought about following four serious Tesla crashes where FSD was engaged and dealing with these types of conditions. One of them was even involved a pedestrian being killed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere’s a bit more history between Elon, Tesla and NHTSA, as explained by Bloomberg:\n\nWhile Musk suggested days after the investigation started that Tesla and his other companies have been subject to “lawfare” by federal regulators, defect probes are par for the course in the US. NHTSA has initiated 155 of them during Biden’s presidency, only modestly more than the 135 opened during Trump’s first term. Tesla vehicles have been the subject of 12 defect investigations opened under Biden. NHTSA has initiated 23 queries into Ford vehicles under Biden, and opened more probes of Stellantis (18) and Honda (14) cars and trucks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s going to be very interesting to see just how much power Musk will wield in Trump’s administration at NHTSA and the Department of Transportation and he’ll be able to make these types of investigations into his many companies disappear. I’m not a betting man, but if I was I’d say the smart money is that these investigations will be dropped. He might get distracted by his dumbass “Department of Governmental Efficiency” though, so who really knows. I suppose it’s also possible Musk could dismantle these agencies through the “shockwaves” he says he’s going to send through Washington, D.C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk has recently been upping the anti when it comes to his messaging about Tesla and autonomy. Here’s what he’s been saying and how NHTSA has reacted, according to Bloomberg:\n\nMusk has leaned into the technology like never before in an effort to differentiate Tesla’s vehicles as sales have slipped. He’s cautioned against owning his company’s stock unless you’re a devotee (“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” he said in April.) Tesla recognized $326 million in revenue last quarter linked to FSD, and some analysts expect software releases to eventually become the predominant generator of the company’s profits. NHTSA has taken notice of Musk’s aggressive messaging. In a filing posted to its website last week — two days after Kamala Harris conceded the presidential race to Trump — the agency attached an email that one of its officials sent to Tesla representatives in May. The official flagged seven of Tesla’s social media posts about FSD that had given the agency pause. The posts showcased drivers who weren’t keeping their hands on the wheel while using FSD, and conveyed messages that conflicted with how Tesla messages to customers in owner’s manuals and elsewhere. NHTSA noted that an X user commented on one of the posts that they could see people getting home safely in a Tesla after drinking at a sporting event — an alarming conclusion to draw about a system that still holds the driver fully responsible for steering, stopping and going. “While Tesla has the discretion to communicate with the public as it sees fit, we note that these posts show lost opportunities to temper enthusiasm for a new product with cautions on its proper use,” Gregory Magno, a division chief within NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation, wrote in the email. [...] “We request that Tesla revisit its communications to assure that its messaging is consistent with the statements made in its user instructions and appropriate to the level of capability deployed to the public roads,” he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’re going to have to wait and see as to whether the Trump Administration allows Tesla to deploy robotaxis on U.S. roads. There is still a long way to go before we get to that point, and hopefully it stays that way.\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to give too much else away. For the full rundown on Musk’s and Trump’s antics and what it means for Tesla, head over to Bloomberg righ now."

Dems should also call off the attack — don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" wrote Musk.\nMusk's post was in response to a clip of the then-former President in which he attacked Musk at a rally for allegedly lying about how he voted, referring to him as a \"bullsh-t artist\", posted by Breitbart News.\n\"Elon is not gonna buy Twitter. Where did you hear that before? From me,\" said Trump.\n\"He's got himself a mess. You know, he said the other day \"Oh I've never voted for a Republican\", and I said \"I didn't know that.\" He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullsh-t artist. But he's not gonna be buying it. He's not gonna be buying it. Although he might later, who the hell knows what's going to happen. He's got a pretty rotten contract,\" he continued.\nTrump then took to Truth Social to recount Musk's visit to the White House during his first presidency, during which Musk asked him for assistance with various projects.\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump wrote.\n\"...Now Elon should focus on getting himself out of the Twitter mess because he could owe $44 billion for something that's perhaps worthless. Also, lots of competition for electric cars!\" Trump continued in another post.\n\"P.S. Why was Elon allowed to break the $15 million stock purchase barrier on Twitter without any reporting? That is a very serious breach! Have fun Elon and @jack, go to it!\" he continued further.\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk tweeted in response.\nMusk previously stated in June of 2022 that he'd cast his first-ever vote for a Republican in voting for Texas special election winner Mayra Flores. Furthermore, he'd stated that he was \"leaning towards\" voting for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis if DeSantis were to run for president in 2024.\nMusk would go on to become a hugely important part of Trump's second presidential campaign, hosting solo rallies in support of the Republican presidential ticket, and even offering a million-dollar-a-day sweepstakes to voters in battleground states through his political action committee, America PAC, to mobilize support for the Trump campaign.\nOriginally published by Latin Times.\n© Latin Times.

Money on the sidelines jumping back into the market (50%)\n2. Reduced regulatory environment (40%)\n3. Proposed Corporate Tax Cuts (10%)• Apple: Cook’s relationship with Trump is strong and we expect the company to avoid the proposed blanket tariffs. Apple is seen as a global symbol of US strength and innovation, a brand that Trump will be reluctant to damage. Regarding Apple’s search deal with Google, my view is evolving and I now believe the outcome is a coin toss given Google’s recent loss regarding default search payment, which was initiated under Trump’s administration. Lastly, I don’t expect the DOJ to pressure Apple around App Store take rates.\n• Meta: In March, Trump posted “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don’t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!” Needless to say, TikTok is going to be around for a while.\n• Tesla: At the highest level, a Trump administration is a meaningful positive for the company, because Elon is not only in Trump’s inner circle but has become almost a family member over the past four months. The relationships will likely make it easier for FSD to receive NHTSA approval, which would be a huge win for the company’s autonomy ambitions. Additionally, Tesla’s corporate tax rate could decline from 21% to 15%, and tariffs could keep Chinese EV competitors out of the US market.\nMacDailyNews Take: As for Google’s search deal with Apple, Munster writes, “The outcome is a coin toss. If the deal gets voided, I believe it would be a net positive for Google and increase its operating income by 5-15% despite the company’s recent comments that voiding the agreement would have ‘unintended’ consequences.”\nMunster is likely wrong about that. Google is an ad company masquerading as a search engine. Apple has a lock on the top demographics – you know, the people with money and the proven will to spend it. Losing Apple product users leaves Google with just a bunch of cheapskate Android settlers and Windows PC sufferers. Google’s ad business will suffer as a result.\nGoogle pays Apple tens of billions of dollars annually to be Safari’s default search engine because Mac, iPhone, and iPad users are extremely demographically desirable (to any company that like to make profits) versus those who settle for Mac, iPhone, and iPad knockoffs.\nIn September 2023, Asymco‘s Horace Dediu did the math and arrived at the conclusion that Apple iPhone owners are 7.4 times more valuable than those who settle for Android phones.\nReal iPhones vs. Poor Man’s iPhones. Same as it ever was. — MacDailyNews, April 22, 2022\nThe bottom line: Those who settle for Android devices are not equal to iOS users. The fact is that iOS users are worth significantly more than Android settlers to developers, advertisers, third-party accessory makers (speakers, cases, chargers, cables, etc.), vehicle makers, musicians, TV show producers, movie producers, book authors, carriers, retailers, podcasters… The list goes on and on.\nThe quality of the customer matters. A lot.\nFacile “analyses” that look only at market (unit) share, equating one Android settler to one iOS user, make a fatal error by incorrectly equating users of each platform one-to-one.\nWhen it comes to mobile operating systems, all users are simply not equal. – SteveJack, MacDailyNews, November 15, 2014\nAndroid is pushed to users who are, in general:\na) confused about why they should be choosing an iPhone over an inferior knockoff and therefore might be less prone to understand/explore their devices’ capabilities or trust their devices with credit card info for shopping; and/or\nb) enticed with “Buy One Get One Free,” “Buy One, Get Two or More Free,” or similar ($100 Gift Cards with Purchase) offers.\nNeither type of customer is the cream of the crop when it comes to successful engagement or coveted demographics; closer to the bottom of the barrel than the top, in fact. Android can be widespread and still demographically inferior precisely because of the way in which and to whom Android devices are marketed. Unending BOGO promos attract a seemingly unending stream of cheapskate freetards just as inane, pointless TV commercials about robots or blasting holes in concrete walls attract meatheads and dullards, not exactly the best demographics…\nGoogle made a crucial mistake: They gave away Android to “partners” who pushed and continue to push the product into the hands of the exact opposite type of user that Google needs for Android to truly thrive. Hence, Android is a backwater of second-rate, or worse, app versions that are only downloaded when free or ad-supported – but the Android user is notoriously cheap, so the ads don’t sell for much because they don’t work very well. You’d have guessed that Google would have understood this, but you’d have guessed wrong.\nGoogle built a platform that depends heavily on advertising support, but sold it to the very type of customer who’s the least likely to patronize ads.\niOS users are the ones who buy apps, so developers focus on iOS users. iOS users buy products, so accessory makers focus on iOS users. iOS users have money and the proven will to spend it, so vehicle makers focus on iOS users.

CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish It's Time To Upgrade To Four-Door Performance Practicality | What Car Should You Buy?\n\nThe study, conducted on 2018-2022 model year vehicles, looked at crashes between 2017 and 2022 that resulted in at least one of the occupants’ death. It found that Teslas have a fatal crash rate of 5.6 per billion miles driven. Kia came in second with a rate of 5.5, followed by Buick at 4.8, Dodge at 4.4 and Hyundai at 3.9. For reference, iSeeCars says the overall average was 2.8, meaning the average Tesla crash is twice as deadly as average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study looked into more than just automakers, though. It also broke vehicles down by individual model. It still wasn’t pretty for Tesla. The Tesla Model Y had a 10.6 fatal crash rate. That’s nearly five times the average for SUVs, and it was the sixth worth score overall. (The Hyundai Venue, Chevy Corvette, Mitsubishi Mirage, Porsche 911 and Honda CR-V Hybrid were above it). The Model S’s score came in at 5.8, two times the average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair to Tesla, these numbers don’t automatically mean its cars are unsafe for occupants. It has a lot more to do with how people drive these cars. Karl Brauer, iSeeCars executive analyst, explained why this was happening in the report:\n\n“Most of these vehicles received excellent safety ratings, performing well in crash tests at the IIHS and NHTSA, so it’s not a vehicle design issue. The models on this list likely reflect a combination of driver behavior and driving conditions, leading to increased crashes and fatalities.” [...] “A vehicle’s size, weight, and height certainly play a part in its ability to protect passengers in a crash. But the biggest contributor to occupant safety is avoiding a crash, and the biggest factor in crash avoidance is driver behavior. A focused, alert driver, traveling at a legal or prudent speed, without being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, is the most likely to arrive safely regardless of the vehicle they’re driving.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this tells us is that Tesla’s cars are probably as safe as anyone else’s, but their owners tend to drive like goons, and the result of that is literally killing people."

        "content": "Dashcams have seen an incredible surge in popularity in recent years.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nFor context, a “dash cam” is a device that typically mounts to the front and rear of the car and allows for constant recording of a car’s surroundings. This can be beneficial in the event of an accident, as the camera allows the driver to capture events as they happen.\n\nIn 2023, the dash cam market was valued at around $4 billion, projected to increase in the coming years. Not only that, but the spread of viral videos of car accidents and fraud attempts may be linked to an increase in dashcam sales.\n\nThe feature has become so popular, in fact, that some cars are offering built-in dashcams as an upgrade. However, some aren’t the biggest fans. This can be seen in the responses to this video from TikToker Tay (@queentayshops) with over 530,000 views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes the Toyota Camry come with a dashcam?\n\nIn her video, Tay shows the dash cam that she purchased as an add-on with her new Toyota Camry.\n\n“I don’t like those janky dash cams where you have to set it up and there’s cords everywhere,” Tay explains. “This is so luxe, and it’s just such a necessity.”\n\nAs Tay notes, the dashcam isn’t included in the base model. It’s an add-on feature that comes with an extra cost. Additionally, the setup is not automatic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When you get your car, you’ll be given a QR code to scan to download the app,” she says. “It is a dash cam app that’s separate from your Toyota app.”\n\nAccording to Tay, this app allows one to easily navigate through various driving “events” as well as splitting up normal drives into two-minute increments.\n\nDespite the additional cost, Tay is convinced it’s worth it.\n\n“Definitely add this on,” she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther Toyota owners aren’t too sure\n\nWhile Toyota does offer this as an option, and Tay seems to be enjoying her dash cam, other Toyota owners haven’t always had the best experience with them.\n\nFor example, some have complained about the high price of the dash cam, which has an MSRP of over $300. For context, the best budget dashcam picks from Wirecutter retailed for less than $200.\n\nOn a Toyota forum, one driver also complained that the video quality was poor, that it was difficult to get warranty support, and that, despite being dubbed an “integrated” dash cam, it seemed to not really be integrated into the car beyond its placement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the comments section, users were mixed about Tay’s add-on.\n\n“You can install a $40 dashcam hidden behind the mirror, with also hidden wires.. and it’s going to connect to your phone too, with better quality,” stated a commenter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s 375 to get the integrated dash cam.. a little pricy but it looks good built in,” added another. “I’d rather purchase one for 30 dollars and have the rear view too.. I don’t think I could justify this.”\n\n“My tesla from 2017 has this included,” offered a third.\n\nThe Daily Dot reached out to Toyota and Tay via email.\n\n\n\nInternet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Five billion dollars are expected from sovereign funds in the Middle East, while the remainder comes from domestic investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Financial Times previously reported that Musk had approached investors in Qatar and Saudi Arabia about backing the startup, which he launched last July as a competitor to Sam Altman’s OpenAI, as well as current investors like Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners. At the time, a $45 billion valuation had been floated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the deal closes, it would more than double the $24 billion valuation xAI reached in May, when the company announced it had raised $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new funds are expected to go toward the acquisition of 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA-0.86% ) chips, CNBC reports. xAI in October won approval to expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is expected to help train Tesla’s (TSLA-1.14% ) AI tech, including Full Self-Driving.\n\nAnd SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company that plans to test a mega-rocket on Monday, is also looking to raise cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe largest private company in the U.S. plans to launch a tender offer next month to sell existing shares at about $135 a pop, according to the Times, citing people who are knowledgeable about the discussions. With that reported offer, SpaceX would be valued at $250 billion, up from $210 billion earlier this year. It would also make it worth more than Bytedance, the company behind TikTok and the most valuable startup in the world.\n\nBoth startups are likely to benefit from Musk’s tight-knit relationship with President-elect Donald Trump, who on Tuesday handed Musk an advisory board to recommend ways to slash regulations and federal spending. He’s already signaled that he will use that job to try and benefit his companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, he agreed with investor Ron Baron’s comments that regulations should be changed so that companies don’t need to repeatedly get permits to launch rockets. He previously said he would work to streamline federal regulations for driverless vehicles, which Tesla is working on. Musk is widely expected to play a role in guiding the Trump administration’s AI initiatives.\n\nIt’s easier to see what effect that relationship has on Tesla, given that it’s a public company. Since its CEO’s big bet on Trump paid off, the stock has boomed, reaching a $1 trillion valuation and surging above $300 per share for the first time since 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n— Britney Nguyen contributed to this article"

        "content": "Tesla introduced its 4680 battery during a massive “Battery Day” event in late 2020, with company CEO Elon Musk then saying the new battery would more than halve the cost to produce batteries for its cars. This was important for Tesla’s plan to build a $25,000 entry-level EV. The battery exists and has been used to fill up the packs of Cybertrucks and some Texas-built Model Ys, but the entry-level car has been delayed long enough that the company hopes everyone has forgotten about it by now. Despite Tesla having allegedly built 100 million 4680 cells, the founder and boss man of CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited), the world’s largest battery manufacturer, basically said Tesla’s batteries suck shit and Elon is a dummy.\n\nWalter Isaacson On Elon Musk(s) CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Walter Isaacson On Elon Musk(s)\n\nWalter Isaacson On Elon Musk(s) CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish Walter Isaacson On Elon Musk(s)\n\nOK, so he didn’t say it in quite those words, but the intent is quite clear. In a recent discussion with Reuters, CATL boss Robin Zeng let his true feelings about Elon Musk out for all to see. The Chinese billionaire has had plenty of opportunity to discuss his feelings face-to-face with the Musk man, as CATL is a major supplier to Tesla’s factory in Shanghai, and is set to supply the Nevada Gigafactory used jointly by Panasonic and Tesla from 2025.\n\nZeng says he told Musk directly that the 4680 “is going to fail and never be successful. We had a very big debate, and I showed him. He was silent. He doesn’t know how to make a battery. It’s about electrochemistry. He’s good for the chips, the software, the hardware, the mechanical things.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCATL passenger vehicle packs tend to use lighter and higher-performance LiFePO4 pouch cells instead of the metal-cased cylinders that Tesla has typically produced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZeng went on to complain to Reuters about Musk’s unrealistic timelines and history of over-promising and under-delivering. According to Zeng, Musk told him that the reason he always commits to a two-year timeline for new projects is that he wants to “motivate and focus Tesla staffers” and that he believes anything beyond two years “might as well be infinity.”\n\n“His problem is overpromising. I talked to him,” Zeng said. “Maybe something needs five years. But he says two years. I definitely asked him why. He told me he wanted to push people. He probably himself thinks it needs five years, but if you believe him when he says two years, you will be in big trouble.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what does that mean for the Cybercab that Musk claims will be delivered in 2026? Is it really coming in two years, or will it be infinity?"

        "content": "Just a small issue of the gas pedal suddenly not working.\n\nOne Job\n\nIf there's one thing the Tesla Cybertruck can be relied on for, it's not being reliable.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tesla announced it was recalling around 2,431 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 6, 2023, and July 30, 2024, due to an issue with their drive inverters that can cause the vehicles to lose propulsion while driving.\n\nThe recall represents roughly eight percent of the 28,250 Cybertrucks that have been sold in the US so far, according to Kelly Blue Book. Moreover, this is the sixth recall for the 2024 model of Tesla pickup, which only began being delivered to customers in November last year.\n\nPower Less\n\nTesla recalls can often sound worse than they actually are, since in many cases they only need over-the-air software updates to fix. This latest one, however, sounds serious and will require owners to bring their cars into the shop.\n\nDue to a fault with certain drive inverters, which are components in EVs that control the power sent to the motor, affected Cybertrucks can stop producing torque even when the driver is pressing down on the accelerator.\n\n\"If the inverter stops producing torque, the driver loses the ability to apply torque to the vehicle using the accelerator pedal resulting in a loss of propulsion, which may increase the risk of a collision,\" Tesla wrote in its recall report submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe automaker said that it first discovered the issue in July after an owner complained of a sudden loss of propulsion in their Cybertruck, with the investigation concluding in late October.\n\nTesla said it will replace the faulty component free of charge — but the wait will be lengthy, as it won't be even starting to carry out the repairs until December 9.\n\nThis Tracks\n\nThe Cybertruck has been scrutinized for its dubious reliability ever since it was released last year.\n\nIn April, every single one of the unorthodox pickups sold in the US was recalled due to a dangerous issue with its gas pedal that caused it to get stuck in the down position.\n\nAnother physical recall came in June, after it was discovered that certain trim pieces could come loose and fly off, and that its enormous front windshield wiper could suddenly stop working. (Mind you, this is a close to $100,000 vehicle.)\n\nAlong with all the tales out there about these stainless steel behemoths suddenly breaking down or malfunctioning, it's not hard to see why the Cybertruck has become a bit of a laughingstock — if not a genuine menace on the road.\n\nMore on the Cybertruck: There's an Unpleasant Surprise When Owners Peel the Vinyl Cover Off Their Cybertrucks"

        "content": "Tesla fan confirms safety advocacy group’s test results showing that Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road.\n\nTesla sought to suppress the group’s test findings by threatening litigation, The Dawn Project stands behind its testing and the results.\n\nSANTA BARBARA, Calif., Nov. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Dawn Project has been conducting safety tests of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software for two and a half years. The results of the safety tests have been shocking and deeply concerning. One of the most egregious safety defects The Dawn Project revealed was that FSD would run down a child crossing the road .\n\nVideo: Tesla Full Self-Driving will Run Down a Child Crossing the Road\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter The Dawn Project publicized the shocking footage, Tesla issued a cease and desist letter in an effort to suppress the safety advocacy group’s findings. Tesla claimed the safety tests had been faked and for the past two years Tesla, Musk and his army of online supporters have attacked The Dawn Project , claiming that the tests were faked or manipulated.\n\nThe Dawn Project has recreated this test with subsequent updates of Full Self-Driving since August 2022. The results remain unchanged - Tesla Full Self-Driving will still run down a child crossing the road.\n\nVideo: The Dawn Project’s tests show that Tesla Full Self-Driving will still run down a child crossing the road\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dawn Project extended an invitation to Tesla, Musk and a number of prominent Tesla fans to conduct collaborative safety testing of Tesla Full Self-Driving. Nearly all of them declined because they knew the tests and results were real. When Tesla investor and former Board candidate Ross Gerber accepted Dan O’Dowd’s invitation, Tesla Full Self-Driving blew past a stop sign at 35mph , nearly T-boning another driver. Gerber has since changed his tune on FSD, saying in an interview recently that FSD ‘ just doesn’t work ’.\n\nSome Tesla supporters have undertaken their own tests, with mixed results. But these tests were materially different from The Dawn Project’s tests and did not constitute a thorough, objective examination of Tesla Full Self-Driving’s critical safety defects.\n\nNow the YouTuber known as Dirty Tesla, who is an avid supporter of Tesla and FSD, has recreated a test similar to The Dawn Project’s, to ascertain whether Full Self-Driving on his Tesla Cybertruck would run down a child in the road. His testing found that FSD would run down a child in the road, validating The Dawn Project’s findings . These results demonstrate that The Dawn Project’s testing has always been accurate and truthful.\n\nWatch: Dirty Tesla’s tests show that Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child standing in the road\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dawn Project’s test results have also been corroborated by third parties including former Tesla self-driving operator John Bernal.\n\nDan O’Dowd, Founder of The Dawn Project, commented: “People used the false argument that we faked this test to claim that The Dawn Project was lying about everything. We weren't. All of our tests are real. No one has ever manipulated our test car in any way. Tesla Full Self-Driving really is as defective and dangerous as The Dawn Project’s tests show.”\n\n“Our tests are all valid, we have repeated them many many times, often with third parties to witness them.”\n\n“Under reasonable circumstances and conditions, Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child in the road.”\n\n“Self-driving software that runs down children must be immediately banned from public roads until this critical safety defect has been fixed.”"

        "content": "President-elect Donald Trump will reportedly cut the EV tax credit when he takes office in January, but contrary to popular belief, Wedbush analysts say the move could actually benefit Trump’s “first buddy,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe Trump transition team is planning to kill the tax credit, Reuters reported Friday, citing two anonymous sources with direct knowledge, and yet representatives from the largest U.S. EV maker, Tesla, favor the move.\n\nWedbush analysts, led by stalwart Tesla bull Dan Ives, said Trump cutting the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs would not be surprising, and that it would take a bigger toll on traditional car manufacturers than on Tesla.\n\n“Tesla has a scale and scope that is unmatched and while losing the EV tax credit could also hurt some demand on the margins in the US, this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples to oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears,” the analysts wrote in the Thursday note.\n\nOn Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call in July, Musk said eliminating the EV tax credit would have a slight impact on Tesla, but added that it would be “devastating” for the competition, which would help Tesla in the long term.\n\nMusk’s growing influence with Trump means he may also have a say in how the incoming administration shapes its EV policy, which could be good for Tesla.\n\n“We believe any sell-off in Tesla from these reports is the wrong knee-jerk reaction and we would be buyers. We maintain our OUTPERFORM rating and $400 price target,” the analysts wrote.\n\nTaking away the tax credit could be supplemented by other incentives and programs to encourage U.S.-made EVs, in line with the president-elect’s focus on reviving domestic manufacturing, the analysts wrote.\n\nYet, for other EV manufacturers, including U.S. automakers like Ford and GM as well as upstart Rivian, cutting the EV tax credit could be a setback, although maybe not as big a hit as some expect, especially for GM and Rivian. Still, cutting the tax credit would be a net negative to the EV industry, according to Wedbush.\n\n“This EV tax credit removal could clearly slow down Detroit’s shift to EVs over the next few years…” the analysts wrote.\n\nWhile the EV tax credit removal may make buying an electric vehicle less appealing for American consumers, Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating said in a statement to Fortune that nothing can stop the growing movement.\n\nSales of EVs through the end of the third quarter were up 9%, Keating noted, and while government-backed sales incentives may have helped adoption, cutting them won’t stop the auto industry’s move to electrification.\n\n“No matter what administration is in the White House, the path is set: EVs will continue to gain share as more choice and competitive pricing entice buyers to go electric,” Keating said in a statement."

Initially, the investors sought a staggering $258 billion in damages, amending their complaint four times over two years.\n\nAt the time of writing, the largest memecoin, with a market cap of $52 billion, is trading at $0.356. Dogecoin has been one of the top performers in the industry’s top 10 digital assets, posting gains of 83% and nearly 190% over the seven—and thirty-day time frames, respectively.\n\nThis was spurred on by the news that Elon Musk would be heading up the new Trump Department of Government Efficiency, or its DOGE acronym, which investors saw as a further sign of support for the dog-themed memecoin.\n\nDespite the recent surge, Dogecoin is still trading 50% below its all-time high of $0.731, set during the 2021 bull run, with high expectations for further gains in the year’s final months.\n\nFeatured image from BBC, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Rental car giant Hertz is dramatically expanding its electric vehicle selloff program, with used Tesla Model 3s now available for under $20,000 as the company grapples with mounting EV depreciation costs. Hertz’s heavy investment in Tesla EVs has been a disaster causing massive losses and the loss of its CEO.\n\nInside EVs reports that Hertz’s ambitious electric vehicle program has hit another significant roadblock, with the company reporting an 89 percent increase in EV depreciation costs, amounting to $537 per vehicle per month. The rental car company has committed to selling 30,000 electric vehicles from its fleet by the end of 2024, marking a stark reversal from its earlier EV adoption strategy.\n\nThe company’s current predicament stems from its bold 2021 initiative to “go green,” which included plans to purchase 100,000 Tesla Model 3s. While this initial vision appeared promising, with benefits including reduced maintenance costs and strong customer interest, the strategy has since encountered numerous challenges that have forced a significant course correction.\n\nA primary factor in Hertz’s EV difficulties has been Tesla’s multiple price reductions, which have severely impacted the residual value of the rental fleet. These price cuts have created a ripple effect throughout the used EV market, leading to accelerated depreciation of Hertz’s electric vehicle assets. The company is now offering used Tesla Model 3s at prices below $20,000, with additional savings possible through the $4,000 federal tax credit available for used EVs.\n\nThe financial impact has been substantial. Beyond the depreciation costs, Hertz has discovered that its Tesla fleet hasn’t delivered the anticipated cost savings. Repair expenses have exceeded expectations, and the company has experienced higher-than-anticipated collision rates with its Tesla vehicles, resulting in significant restoration costs and extended repair times.\n\nThese compounding factors have contributed to multiple quarters of losses, resulting in the resignation of CEO Stephen Scherr earlier this year.\n\nThe financial nightmare has Hertz’s new leadership to initiate a widespread divestment of its EV fleet. The company plans to maintain only enough electric vehicles to meet actual customer demand for EV rentals, marking a significant scaling back of its original electric mobility ambitions.\n\nThe selloff program will continue through 2025, with the company attempting to minimize losses as used EV values continue to decline. Current market prices for these vehicles appear to be stabilizing between $20,000 and $25,000, providing some predictability to the company’s loss mitigation efforts.\n\nRead more at Inside EVs here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship."

        "content": "Big quote: Zeng remarking on Musk's tendency to overpromise on timelines. \"Maybe something needs five years,\" Zeng said. \"But he says two years. I definitely asked him why. He told me he wanted to push people.\"\n\nRobin Zeng, the founder and chairman of CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.), the world's largest EV battery company based in Ningde, China, has made a blunt assessment of Tesla's ambitious 4680 battery project, declaring it \"is going to fail and never be successful.\" Zeng's prediction, made during an interview with Reuters, underscores a deepening debate within the EV industry regarding the future of battery technology and Tesla's strategic direction.\n\nTesla's 4680 battery cells, named for their dimensions (46mm diameter and 80mm length), are a significant technological bet for the company. Introduced in 2020, these cells were touted as a game-changer in EV battery technology. Tesla claimed the new design would offer five times more energy capacity and significant cost reductions compared to their previous battery designs.\n\nThe 4680 cells have already found their way into some Tesla vehicles, including the Cybertruck. Moreover, the company reached a significant milestone in September, announcing that it produced 100 million of these cells – an achievement that came just over three months after Tesla had announced producing 50 million 4680 cells, indicating a rapid acceleration in production.\n\nZeng and Musk reportedly clashed over Tesla's battery strategy during a heated debate in an April meeting. According to Zeng, Musk was silent in the face of Zeng's critique. \"He doesn't know how to make a battery,\" Zeng told Reuters.\n\nZeng believes Tesla lacks the expertise to successfully develop and manufacture the 4680 cells at scale. Indeed, scaling up production of the 4680 cells has proven difficult. Tesla has faced issues with the cells collapsing in on themselves during use. Other battery manufacturers like Panasonic have also cautioned about technical problems hindering mass production.\n\nAlso, Tesla's plan to employ dry electrode technology – an innovation aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency – has not achieved the anticipated results at a mass production level. This technology was a cornerstone of Tesla's vision for the 4680 cells but has posed significant implementation challenges.\n\nTesla and CATL maintain a complex and interdependent relationship. CATL supplies batteries for Tesla's vehicles produced in China, including models sold in North America. The Chinese company specializes in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which, while generally offering less range than cylindrical cell units, provide advantages in cost and safety.\n\nThe disagreement between these two major players in the EV industry underscores the ongoing debate about the future of battery technology. While Tesla continues to heavily invest in its proprietary 4680 cells, CATL and other manufacturers are exploring alternative approaches, such as advancements in LFP batteries and the development of solid-state batteries.\n\nZeng also touched on Musk's leadership style in the Reuters interview, particularly his tendency to set ambitious timelines. Zeng noted that Musk often promises delivery times that are shorter than realistically achievable, a strategy Musk reportedly employs to \"push people.\" This approach has led to skepticism in the industry and among consumers, especially regarding promises about technologies like full self-driving."

Power.\n\nPart of the reason is due to a tax credit program that the Cybertruck has been largely left out of.\n\nTesla is offering the Cybertruck for lease a year after the EV company made its first deliveries to customers.\n\nUnder a three-year lease with no down payment and 10,000 annual miles, leasing a Cybertruck costs $1,249 per month, not including taxes and fees, according to Tesla's website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cybertruck, which has a base MSRP of $79,990, makes up a small part of Tesla's overall volume production, but it still plays an important role in CEO Elon Musk's hopes to compete in the crowded pickup truck segment. In its third-quarter earnings report from October, Tesla reported that the Cybertruck reached profitability for the first time in less than a year since deliveries were made to customers in November 2023.\n\nLeasing an electric vehicle has become a popular option for consumers. According to J.D. Power, a market research firm, 46% of EV purchases, not including Tesla, were leases in 2023.\n\nEV maker Rivian said during its third-quarter earnings call earlier this month that 42% of vehicles sold were leased. According to Rivian's website, the company's lowest-priced vehicle is the R1T truck, which costs $69,900.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last few years leasing became a popular financing option for EVs due largely to a $7,500 federal tax credit issued under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nUnder the program, drivers buying an EV with cash or through a loan could be eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, making the overall purchase more affordable. However, the credit only comes if certain provisions are met, such as vehicle manufacturing requirements, whether the buyer remains under an income threshold, and if the vehicle's price doesn't exceed $80,000.\n\nHowever, leasing an EV offers buyers another way to take advantage of the tax credit program without meeting every requirement. Through what's known as a \"leasing loophole,\" dealerships can receive the tax credit and choose to pass those savings on to the buyer or lessee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRivian said during its earnings call earlier this month that lessees make up a large population of those who take advantage of the tax incentive program.\n\nBut Tesla's Cybertruck has largely been left out of the federal incentive program. A spokesperson for the Internal Revenue Service pointed BI to the Department of Energy's website, which has a list of eligible vehicles under the federal program. The Cybertruck was not listed.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

        "content": "A devastating accident in Toronto involving a Tesla Model Y resulted in the tragic deaths of four individuals and the miraculous rescue of a young woman. The crash, which occurred on October 24, has raised serious questions about the safety of Tesla’s electronic door mechanisms.\n\nA Tesla Model Y carrying five passengers lost control while traveling at high speed. The vehicle struck a guardrail and subsequently collided with a concrete pillar, bursting into flames upon impact. The collision took place on a local roadway, as confirmed by Toronto Police Duty Inspector Phillip Sinclair during a news conference.\n\nThree men, aged 26, 29, and 32, and a 30-year-old woman were pronounced dead at the scene. A 25-year-old woman survived the horrific accident and was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe sole survivor owes her life to the quick actions of Rick Harper, a 73-year-old Canada Post worker, who came upon the burning vehicle. Harper, along with other bystanders, noticed that the passengers were trapped inside the Tesla, unable to open the electronic doors.\n\nHarper recounted to the Toronto Star, “You couldn’t open the doors. I would assume the young lady would have tried to open the door from the inside because she was pretty desperate to get out.” Harper grabbed a bar from his truck and handed it to another bystander, who managed to break the back window and pull the young woman to safety.\n\nALSO READ: Elon Musk Responds to Young Girl Who Found Bug in Tesla Model 3\n\nThe Tesla Model Y’s electronic doors, which require power to operate, have come under scrutiny following the accident. Authorities are investigating whether the failure of these doors contributed to the fatalities. Harper mentioned that the thick smoke made it difficult to see the other passengers trapped inside, further complicating rescue efforts.\n\nTesla has faced criticism in the past for the design of its manual release levers, which are considered poorly designed and unintuitively placed. These emergency measures require intimate knowledge of the car, something that may not be feasible in a panic situation.\n\nALSO READ: Tesla Warns Against Wet Towel Method for Supercharging\n\nThe Toronto Police and fire authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the crash. Deputy Fire Chief Jim Jessop stated that they are examining the possibility that the intensity of the fire was linked to the car’s battery cells.\n\nThe crash has also highlighted concerns about the safety of electric vehicles in high-speed collisions. Despite the presence of manual release mechanisms in most Tesla models, the ease of access and usability of these features remain contentious issues.\n\nIn a press release, Inspector Sinclair emphasized that no other vehicles were involved in the crash, and the investigation is ongoing. He also extended gratitude to Harper for his brave actions, stating, “Thanks very much to that bystander. We have been speaking to them, and obviously, they also are deeply affected by this incident, a very horrific scene for that bystander to step in.”\n\nHarper expressed his shock and sorrow after learning about the deaths of the other passengers. “I was totally shocked. It really hit me when I saw the report in the news that four had died,” he told CBC News. Harper was later informed by detectives that the young woman he rescued was recuperating in the hospital.\n\nThis tragic incident has sparked a debate about the safety features of electric vehicles and the necessity for more intuitive emergency mechanisms. As authorities continue their investigation, the focus remains on understanding the causes of the crash and preventing such tragedies in the future.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the company is likely to face increased scrutiny over the safety and design of its vehicles’ electronic systems. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with advanced automotive technology and the importance of accessible emergency features."

        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently nixed hopes of a regular Tesla model ever selling for $25,000.\n\nBut he was talking about new models. For car rental company Hertz, the race to sell used Teslas and other EVs at ever-lower prices is not only still on but accelerating.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHertz had kicked off 2024 by announcing it was trying to get rid of 20,000 previously rented, used electric vehicles at “no-haggle prices” before the end of the year. By the end of April, that figure had risen to 30,000 EVs, with average selling prices of around $25,000.\n\nNow, with less than two months to finish the year, prices are reaching new lows. Up high on the sales page of the car rental company’s website, you can find used Teslas going for less than $20,000, Chevrolet Bolt EVs under $14,000, and Hyundai Kona electric SUVs under $13,000.\n\nAnd for car buyers ready to act fast, those vehicles are still eligible for the Biden administration’s $4,000 tax incentive for used EVs. It was recently reported that the incoming Trump administration intends to end federal tax credits upon the purchase or lease of EVs.\n\nHertz-certified EVs are given a 115-point inspection and include a 12-month or 12,000-mile limited powertrain warranty. The car rental company also sells vehicle protection plans that last beyond the warranty.\n\nBuyers can also return a vehicle within seven days or 250 miles after their purchase, whichever comes first.\n\nHertz decided to electrify its fleet of rental vehicles back in 2021, ordering hundreds of thousands of Teslas, Polestars, and GM models. The move initially made sense, as maintenance costs for EVs are much lower than for gas-powered vehicles.\n\nBut the car-rental company got blindsided by Tesla’s moves to slash the price of new models, which drastically reduced the value of used vehicles. By 2023, Hertz’ EV fleet faced an accelerating rate of depreciation it could no longer handle, triggering the fire sale."

        "content": "A longstanding electric vehicle (EV) incentive is on the cusp of disappearance, and Elon Musk, the owner of the world's largest EV maker, is perfectly happy to see it go.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is reportedly planning to nix the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers early into his administration, a move that could deeply harm certain legacy automakers. Reuters first reported the plan on Thursday.\nTesla, however, would be poised to benefits since those plans would hurt its rivals, while maintaining its dominance in the American market, and possibly even expanding its lead over competitors. Tesla is the only automaker making a profit on its EV sales in the U.S. Legacy automakers, like General Motor and Ford, are losing money on EV sales because they sell only a fraction of Tesla's volume and are yet to achieve the economies of scale with their electric product lines that Tesla has mastered.\nMusk, one of Trump's most prominent backers and a new member of the Trump administration, has said that eliminating the tax credits could be \"slightly\" bad for his company, but that \"long term\" the move \"probably actually helps Tesla.\"\nBut why would ending a credit that incentivizes Americans to buy EVs be good for one company and not the others?\nTesla, having released its first car in 2008, has had longer than other companies to benefit from government subsidies that were created to encourage the development of electric vehicles.\nIn 2010, Tesla received a $465 million loan from the Department of Energy to produce electric vehicles and to develop a manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. The loan was paid off in 2013. The company also benefitted from nearly $3 billion from the credits offered to EV buyers, according to Subsidy Track's database, which tracks subsidies from 2000 to today.\n\"Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\" Musk, who was recently tapped to serve as the co-chair of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in July. \"Also, remove subsidies from all industries!\"\nThe rest of the industry disagrees.\nIn a Friday press release shared with Newsweek, Mike Murphy, the founder and CEO of the American EV Jobs Alliance, said the group would vocally oppose efforts to repeal Obama or Biden-era EV policies, adding that it would be \"misguided\" for an incoming Trump administration to do so and \"ironic,\" given that much of the new spending in the field happens to be in red states.\n\"This is very unfortunate news for American consumers and autoworkers who are benefitting from the $188 billion surge in new manufacturing capacity in the U.S. to design and manufacture the vehicles of the future and to compete globally,\" Murphy said. \"This means lost jobs, more pollution, and a strategic advantage to our competitors in a rapidly growing Chinese automotive industry.\"\nThe Alliance for Automative Innovation, an industry group representing Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota, and others, also urged Congress to keep the tax credits in an October letter that called the rebate \"critical to cementing the US as a global leader in the future of automotive technology and manufacturing.\"\nWith that head start, Tesla has been able to soar ahead of other competitors. It's market lead is so unshakable that even though an end to the tax credits would bring down the price of all EVs, Tesla would only see its profits reduced. Tesla's rivals, on the other hand, would watch profits shrink while also reporting increased losses, making it even harder for them to enter the market and compete in the industry's pricing war.\n\"Tesla has a significant advantage over most automakers in terms of manufacturing efficiency and scale, which gives its vehicles higher profit margins and greater resilience to removing the tax credit,\" Paul Waatti, a manager at AutoPacific's Product Analysis, told Newsweek.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Tesla reported a pre-tax profit margin of 18 percent, double the industry average of 9 percent. High earnings are coming in even as Tesla's vehicles are priced significantly lower than rival EVs. It's most affordable car, the Model 3, is more than $14,000 cheaper than the average EV, according to data from Kelly Blue Book.\nOf the nearly 600,000s EVs sold in the U.S. during the first two quarters of 2023, nearly half were made by Tesla, while just over 7 percent were made by Ford, the manufacturer with the second-highest number of EV sales.\n\"Legacy automakers are simultaneously tasked with maintaining ICE [internal combustion engines] portfolios and scaling a new EV business where profitability is already scarce, relying more on subsidies to make the business case pencil,\" Waatti said.\nTo respond to those new losses, Tesla's competitors may need to further pull back EV production to shift their focus back on ICE products, meaning less competition for Musk and another edge up in the EV pricing war his company waged after drastically slashing prices in the last year.\nTesla, which was forced to cut the prices of its vehicles when an earlier version of the tax credit phased out in 2019, probably would not have to do the same as other EV makers.\nEven after the report of Trump's proposed tax cut sent down shares of Tesla and other automakers, Musk's 715 million shares and options to buy Tesla stock are still worth $42.7 billion more than than where they closed on Election Day. Tesla shares closed down 7 percent this week, while Rivian shares fell 5 percent.\nWhat Are the EV Tax Credits?\nAs part of his administration's goal of having 50 percent of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030, President Joe Biden signed the expansive Inflation Reduction Act into law in August 2022 that included up to $7,500 in rebates for Americans who purchase new electric vehicles for the next decade. The law went into effect January 1, 2023.\nStill, as of April 2023, those tax credits were only available for 14 models of electric cars and trucks, about 15 percent of the vehicles available for Americans to purchase. The administration expanded the list of qualifying vehicles to include at least 38 EV models.\nThe Biden White House said in a January fact sheet that EV sales have more than quadrupled since Biden took office, bringing the total number of EVs on the road to more than 4.5 million cars. The White House also said the president had made EVs more affordable, with prices down 20 percent from last year, and charging more accessible, with publicly available ports growing by over 70 percent.\n\"Without federal support, the growth of EV infrastructure in the U.S., such as charging stations, might slow, affecting EVs' overall feasibility and attractiveness to consumers,\" Waati said.\nWhat Has Elon Musk Said About the Tax Credits?\nMusk, however, has long held that Tesla doesn't need federal rebates or charging support.\nAsked about Biden's infrastructure plan in 2021, Musk told the Wall Street Journal, \"Honestly, I would just can this whole bill. Don't pass it. That's my recommendation.\" He also called federal support for more charging stations \"unnecessary\" and pushed the government to get rid of subsidies for oil and gas as well.\n\"When we started Tesla, there were no EV subsidies and gasoline was super cheap,\" Musk said during the WSJ's CEO Council Summit. \"We did not anticipate any subsidies, that came later and the $7500 tax credit came as a result, not of Tesla activity, but of General Motors lobbying for it.\"\nTesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja echoed his boss' position during a July earnings call, noting that while the company has taken advantage of federal support, \"we always drive ourselves to say, OK, what if there is no IRA benefit? And how do we operate in that kind of an environment? Like Elon said, we definitely have a big advantage as compared to our competition on that front.\"\nDuring his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to kill what he called Biden's \"EV mandate.\" No such mandate exists in federal law. Yet, last year, Tesla lobbied the government for the same regulations that that the political right has blasted. In a filing with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Tesla said outright that an end to the manufacture of gasoline cars was \"essential\" to address the \"rapidly escalating climate crisis.\"\n\"Elon tends to say he's hostile to subsidies while Tesla is gobbling them up like a hungry Godzilla,\" Murphy told CNBC in August.\nAnd though Musk and Trump are close now, there was a time Musk was critical of Trump's climate change actions, or lack thereof. The Tesla CEO quit the Trump White House's advisory panels five months into the Republican's first term after the administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, which Musk said at the time \"is not good for America or the world.\"\nDo U.S. Consumers Want EV Tax Credits?\nAbout six months after the $7,500 credit was signed into law, only 8 percent of U.S. adults said they or someone else in their household owns or leases an EV.\nThe poll, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in February 2023, found that only 4 in 10 said they would be at least somewhat likely to buy an electric model the next time they buy a car.\nMore than a a year later, Americans were unmoved. The pollsters' June 2024 survey showed that the number of Americans willing to go electric remained the same. The share of people who said they or someone else in their household owns or leases an EV went up a single point, to 9 percent.\nIt also seems like many consumers just might not be aware it exists.\nA BlueLab Analytics poll conducted in August 2023—a year after the federal subsidies wee signed into law—showed that there were still 40 percent of Americans who did not know about the EV tax credit. Only 22 percent said they knew \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount\" about the incentive. Another 34 percent said they knew \"a little.\"\nWhat About the EV Mandates Set by Blue States?\nEven if Trump changes the current climate policies in place, there are 12 Democratic-led states that—beginning with 2026 or 2027 models—will require 35 percent of new cars to be electric. That means EV makers would need to double or triple their sales in just one year.\nThe mandates are part of the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars regulations that require 100 percent of new vehicle sales in California to be zero-emission models by 2035.\n\"If EV growth is stalled, meeting state-level ZEV mandates will also be more challenging for automakers,\" Waatti said. \"This likely leads to increased compliance costs for manufacturers and potential legal or regulatory conflicts between state and federal policies.\"\nAs of this year, none of those states are in accordance with the CARB mandates. The only state on track to reach that goal is California, where EVs account for 27 percent of new car sales. In Colorado and Washington, EVs represent 22 percent and 20 percent of new retail sales, respectively. Other states lag much further behind. EVs represent just 9 percent and 5 percent of cars sold in Rhode Island and New Mexico, respectively, this year.\nJack Hollis, president of Toyota Motor North America, said last week that it \"looks impossible\" to meet the California-led mandates. During a virtual roundtable, he said it would be \"unnatural\" to funnel more EVs into an unwelcoming market, ultimately \"limit[ing] a customer's choice of the vehicles they want.\"\n\"It's going to distort the industry. It's going to distort the business. Why? Because it's unnatural to what the current demand in the marketplace is,\" Hollis said.\nThe longtime auto executive said Toyota would prefer a single national standard across all 50 states so that \"we can treat all customers, all dealers, equally, fairly, whatever that might be.\"\nAbout the writer\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City.

        "content": "Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIf new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nCurrent federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.\n\nWhile the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.\n\nOne candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said.\n\nRepublican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.\n\nThe transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment.\n\nHe supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.\n\nTrump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.\n\nPast efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.\n\nNHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.\n\nA bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases."

Otherwise, we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,” ZETA executive director Albert Gore said in a statement.\n\nThe statement of support comes in response to reports that the incoming Trump administration plans to end the current $7,500 federal tax credit on the purchase or lease of an EV. Under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), an EV with key components, including batteries, made in the U.S. is eligible for the incentive upon purchase or lease of the vehicle.\n\nAccording to some estimates, the share of EVs is expected to grow to 33% of the U.S. market in 2030. But repealing tax incentives on the production and sales of EVs is expected to reduce that share by at least 5%.\n\nDespite the expected hit to EV sales, Trump’s plan to end the incentive has received the blessings of representatives from Tesla, the bestselling EV maker in the U.S. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was recently appointed by the incoming administration to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nWhile campaigning, Trump has promised to impose massive tariffs on imports, especially those from China. Earlier this year, the Biden administration already imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nChina’s BYD, widely recognized as a global leader in the production of affordable EVs, recently backtracked from plans to reach the North American market."

        "publish_date": "2024-11-17T07:23:46Z",
        "content": "Some people think they’re too good to deal with a little inconvenience, even when it’s just moving their car to make way for a job to get done.\n\nSo what would you do if a stubborn driver refused to budge, blocking your delivery setup and expecting you to wait for them?\n\nWould you politely ask again?\n\nOr would you set up shop and let them deal with the delay?\n\nIn the following story, a fuel delivery man deals with this exact dilemma.\n\nHere’s what happened.\n\nWon’t move your car? Enjoy the hour wait. And a car accident. The other day, I (25m) was delivering fuel to a gas station. This station was set up where the tank access lids are right by the parking spots. For me to be in a position to dump fuel, I need to block ALL of the parking spots in front of the building. There’s usually a car or 2 in the way, and I can usually patiently wait until I’m clear to pull in. If it’s a busy time of day, I put cones up as cars leave to prevent anyone else from pulling in until I’ve moved into position. But THIS TIME, a lady in a Tesla absolutely couldn’t handle parking 50 feet away and HAD to move my cone to park right in front of the door. I hopped out of my truck and went inside to ask her to move so I could deliver the gas, and she told me, “Get bent. You can wait until I’m done here.”\n\nShe didn’t like her words thrown back at her.\n\nSo, I pulled my truck in behind her with about 2 inches to spare between my truck axles and her bumper. I set my brakes and begin hooking up hoses to unload. Since I couldn’t park in the ideal position, my large 3″ hose was too short to reach the hole, so I used my 2″ hose, which is longer but does limit the flow rate by about 33%. No sooner than 5 seconds after I’ve opened my valve to start the fuel delivery, she comes out screaming that she’s in a hurry and I need to move my truck before she calls the cops for harassment. I told her, “Get bent. You can wait until I’m done here.”\n\nAngry, she demands to know how long it will take.\n\nShe asked me how long it would take. I informed her that normally it would be about 45 minutes, but because I had to use my smaller hose, I figured it would be about an hour and 15 minutes. She stormed off, got in her car, and called the cops. About 10 minutes later, 2 officers arrive and ask what the problem is. She wants me arrested for harassment. Gas station employee sides with me, saying the woman was rude and belligerent and I’m just here to do my job.\n\nShe got a little too impatient and drove into oncoming traffic.\n\nThe cops tell her she’s just going to have to wait, and they leave. I took my sweet time unloading and doing my paperwork. In total, she waited an hour and a half before I moved my truck when I left. As I was waiting to pull out of the parking lot, she zoomed around me and pulled out into the street….DIRECTLY into the path of oncoming traffic. She was t-boned by a lifted pickup with a heavy-duty cattle guard bumper! Her Tesla was totaled, and the pickup was completely unscathed. She was not injured, but I almost had an asthma attack from laughing so hard😂\n\nWow! Now that’s a great story!\n\nLet’s see what the folks over at Reddit had to say about this situation.\n\nThis is a great system!\n\nLet’s hope not, but probably!\n\nThis lady knows all about fuel delivery stories.\n\nThat’s a fitting motto!\n\nThis lady deserved it!\n\nNext time, maybe she’ll not be so rude and just move her car.\n\nIf you liked that post, check out this story about a customer who insists that their credit card works, and finds out that isn’t the case."

One of those is respect free speech, especially in our European allies,” he warned.\n\nFor Musk, hostility to the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) is about more than just business: along with supporters on the American right he increasingly paints it as an ideological battle against censorship.\n\n“The election in the US will not impact our enforcement work,” a spokesman for the European Commission — the powerful tech enforcer for the 27-nation EU — told AFP.\n\nBut experts are not so sure.\n\n– Billions in fines? –\n\nMusk’s X platform was formally accused by the commission in July of misleading users with its blue checkmarks for certified accounts, of insufficient advertising transparency and failing to give researchers access to the platform’s data.\n\nThe allegations are part of a wider DSA inquiry into how X tackles the spread of illegal content and information manipulation.\n\nEach offence could theoretically trigger a fine of up to six percent of the annual global turnover of all the companies Musk controls — reaching into the billions.\n\nAccording to several sources close to the proceedings, the commission was wrapping up its probe — and readying a heavy fine — when its digital chief Thierry Breton quit in September, having been denied a second term by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nBut the stars have since realigned, with the EU now caught in the headlights for fear the volatile Trump will start a trade war and cut support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.\n\n– ‘Provoke’ Trump? –\n\nWith Trump at the reins, enforcing EU tech rules against X may become a matter of politics as much as anything else.\n\n“I’d be surprised if the commission chooses to provoke Trump over something like this,” said Alexandre de Streel, an expert at the Center on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) think tank.\n\n“Transatlantic relations are going to become more complicated — and this probably isn’t the area where they will need to fight hardest,” he said.\n\n“Musk believes the DSA goes too far in how it asks platforms to regulate content — and that is also the view of far-right parties in Europe,” de Streel noted. “It’s become a battle of ideas, and I don’t see Musk folding — especially not now.”\n\nThe European Commission also has to factor in Trump’s hard-right allies within the bloc, from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Italian leader Giorgia Meloni.\n\nAfter Trump’s re-election, von der Leyen stressed the importance of the EU-US “partnership” and a “strong transatlantic agenda” — a stance echoed by Breton’s designated successor as digital enforcer, Henna Virkkunen.\n\n“With war on its doorstep, Europe must think carefully,” said Umberto Gambini, of European affairs consultancy Forward Global. “I don’t think it can afford to upset Trump in these first months.”\n\nGambini predicts that the commission’s probes into X will keep ticking along but the departure of Breton — who clashed spectacularly with Musk via social media — will offer a chance to reset the relationship.\n\nAlready back in August, Brussels had distanced itself from a letter of warning sent by the French commissioner before Musk interviewed Trump live on X.\n\nThat said, “if Europe wants to remain credible” in the fight to rein in Big Tech, it “has to keep threatening fines in the billions, not millions”, Gambini said.\n\nBut with fragile transatlantic ties in mind, it may choose to focus its firepower on Chinese platforms such as TikTok instead, judged the EU expert."

That list includes billionaire Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, who has been tapped by Trump to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency taskforce, which aims to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies,” per the President-elect.\n\nWeekend Update anchor Michael Che noted that Musk had shared job listings for the new taskforce, which state employees will be working “80-plus hours per week for no money.”\n\n“You can’t be surprised that the white African guy’s first idea is slavery,” Che said.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nChe’s co-anchor Colin Jost also got a few jabs in, opening the segment with digs at attorney general pick Matt Gaetz, who was once embroiled in a sex trafficking investigation (which led to no charges) and now faces a new accusation of having sex with a minor. Gaetz resigned as a Congress member earlier this week after being tapped to join Trump’s administration.\n\n“Trump nominated Matt Gaetz for attorney general and Gaetz said the same thing he says when he sees a teenage girl: I’ll do it,” Jost said, getting some groans from the crowd. He continued with, “Gaetz, who was created when Frankenstein raped Dracula, was chosen for attorney general after Trump remembered that his original pick was found in dead a jail cell,” making a reference to the officially ruled suicide of sex criminal and New York financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n“Congratulations to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who became the first brain worm survivor nominated to a cabinet level position,” Jost said in a later segment. “Kennedy, whose skin is always cooked to a perfect medium rare, will lead the Department of Health and Human Services. I know he doesn’t have a lot of experience, but I say we give him a shot,” he continued, referencing Kennedy’s much-touted skepticism regarding vaccinations.\n\nCharli XCX pulled double-duty as both host and musical guest for this week’s “Saturday Night Live.”"

        "content": "Crypto analyst John Burr on TradingView has discussed the potential for the Dogecoin price to reach $3 this market cycle. Driven by the positive sentiments from recent political events spearheaded by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Burr has revealed that Dogecoin can not only reach $3 but could skyrocket to $20.\n\nUS Politics Could Drive DOGE To $3\n\nAccording to the TradingView analyst, the Dogecoin price could be preparing for a strong bull run to the $3 target. In his report, Burrs discussed the effects of political changes on the crypto market, underscoring the changes the recent US Presidential elections have had on the Dogecoin price.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBased on its price chart, Burr claims that Dogecoin is repeating historical trends which signal an impending bull rally. The analyst also mentioned a correlation to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), hinting at future government actions or pro-crypto regulations indirectly impacting cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration ceremony as the 47th US President could also trigger the next bullish movement in the crypto market. As a result, Burr predicts that the Dogecoin price could surge to $3 on Inauguration Day.\n\nConsidering that Dogecoin is trading below the $1 mark, the analyst has acknowledged that his bullish predictions for the meme coin could be wrong. He is focusing instead on the broader crypto bull market. He revealed that the market is currently at the beginning of the bull run, which gives Dogecoin more wiggle room for growth.\n\nBurrs has revealed that to some analysts, a $3 price target for Dogecoin may be conservative as they have projected extreme targets around the $40 level by next year. The analyst noted that skeptical crypto experts are unlikely to forecast an ATH beyond $3 for the DOGE price, primarily citing market cap concerns. This suggests that the DOGE market cap will have to exceed that of significant cryptocurrencies, possibly surpassing Bitcoin before it can reach $40.\n\nThis substantial price and market cap increase appears unattainable, as it would require a sustained, strong demand and investor interest in Dogecoin. However, due to its meme coin status and the frequent occurrence of negative market conditions, maintaining such extensive demand could pose a challenge for Dogecoin, which remains vulnerable to market fluctuations.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCan The Dogecoin Price Reach $20?\n\nIn his TradingView post, Burr also highlighted the possibility of the Dogecoin price reaching new highs at $20. The analysts acknowledged his doubts about the feasibility of this ambitious price leap, which stands in sharp contrast to his earlier confidence in the $3 prediction for the DOGE price.\n\nA $20 target represents a massive price increase for Dogecoin, which is currently trading at $0.37. Dogecoin will have to experience price gains of about 5,300%, driven by extremely bullish conditions, favorable market sentiment, and widespread adoption.\n\nFeatured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2024/11/17/tesla-puts-incentives-on-blast-as-tax-credit-comes-under-threat/",
        "publish_date": "2024-11-17T08:06:17Z",
        "content": "Tesla’s inventory page underscores the critical role the federal tax credit plays in driving sales. The price with the incentive is now displayed front and center in bold print before you click through to buy or lease. The inventory page often offers some of the best deals on new Teslas.\nThe $7,500 federal tax credit — now in the crosshairs of the incoming administration — in practice serves as an instant, point-of-sale discount for many buyers. For inventory page purchases in California, Tesla bundles the $7,500 tax credit with “5-year gas savings” to render a promotional price. In the case of leases, the credit is typically applied over the term of the lease as a discount on monthly payments.\nThis is in contrast to General Motors dealers — now selling a wide variety of relatively pricey new EVs — who don’t always broadcast the federal incentive and sometimes bury it deeper in the website.\nIncentive drives pricing for Tesla Model Y and Model 3\nBoth the Model Y and Model 3 get hefty discounts courtesy of the federal tax credit. Long-range all-wheel drive Model Ys can be found for under $40K in inventory and Model 3s drop to around $35K with the incentive. That can be the difference between affordability and unaffordability for many buyers. In October, the average sticker price for EVs was $63,901 compared to $45,620 for ICE (gas-powered) vehicles, according to a research note released this past week by Edmunds. (Update: Tesla has added its own incentive and reduced the Model Y Long-Range Rear Wheel Drive lease to $299 a month.)\nGM offers the tax incentive on most of its EVs but it’s not always obvious\nIn 2025, GM is positioning itself to become a major force in EVs. But dealers sometimes still struggle to make an effective sales pitch for GM’s electric lineup. More than a few Chevy dealers in Los Angeles, for instance, don’t make it clear up front that the buyer can shave $7,500 off the price of an EV. Dealers tend to show conventional “savings” or incentives that are not related to the tax credit. Only drilling down on dealer websites will reveal the federal tax credit. That’s ironic because GM is now flooding the market with a raft of new electric vehicles, including the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Cadillac Optiq, and Cadillac Escalade IQ. A redesigned Chevy Bolt is also due later and possibly a Buick EV.\nFor instance, some Los Angeles dealers are offering heavy discounts on the Chevy Blazer EV. With the federal tax credit, that can bring the down price to under $35,000 (as of mid-November 2024) The $7,500 credit becomes the difference between a pricey $42K+ Blazer and an affordable sub-$35K one.\nThe end is near?\nBut it’s also possible that GM dealers don’t want to push this incentive too hard in light of its possible elimination. If and when the incentive goes away, as President-elect Trump has hinted at, it could be a reset for the EV market. Trump spoke out frequently against EVs in campaign speeches, claiming that an “EV mandate” has the effect of coercing consumers to buy EVs. “The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration — without another form of incentive to replace it — could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,” said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights, in a statement.\nEdmunds added that tax credit can be the critical factor in closing the price gap between EVs and gas vehicles. Although the average sticker price for EVs is about $18,000 more than gas vehicles, the average monthly payments for both EVs and gas vehicles are nearly the same due to incentives like the federal tax credit, Edmunds said.\nIf the tax credit disappears, leases stand to take a hit too. Any may have unintended consequences. “Regarding pricing, this is a huge issue...Currently there are a lot of attractive lease deals out there, and they are driving lease sales forward,” said Tom Libby, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility. “But what if the actual value three years from now is below the residual agreed to in the current lease contract?”\nAnd American jobs could be impacted also. “There needs to be a demand signal - like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit - aligned with that goal [of bringing jobs to the U.S.], otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,” said ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore in a statement this week."

It’s unclear if she plans to purchase either the vehicle or the robot, but she has been a supporter of Musk and Tesla in the past, posting with her own custom Cybertruck shortly after they were unveiled.\n\nTesla has reportedly been testing its robotaxi service with its employees in the San Francisco area. While autonomous cars operated by rival Waymo are on the streets, driving paying passengers around in multiple cities, Tesla’s robotaxi plans are still a work in progress.\n\nMusk has promised that the robotaxi will be affordable, in the $30,000 region, when it hits the market. But the exact timeline remains fuzzy."

        "content": "The soon-to-be-formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, shared some examples of obscene government waste on Monday so Americans can have some clear examples of what needs to be cut.\n\nDOGE shared a clip of Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), widely known for his annual Festivus government waste report, walking through some of the most shocking ways the U.S. government has wasted taxpayer dollars.\n\nOne of the studies highlighted by both Paul and DOGE in involves seeing what makes a sunfish more aggressive: Gin or tequila. About $100,000 went toward that project.\n\nThe U.S. government also spent nearly one million on a study to see if cocaine makes Japanese quail more “sexually promiscuous.”\n\nIt does not end there, either. The U.S. government also spent $750,000 to determine if Neil Armstrong’s famed line was actually “One small step for man” or “one small step for ‘a’ man.” DOGE pointed out that the study was “inconclusive.”\n\nThe clip shared by DOGE also features Sen. Paul noting that $2 million was spent on the “construction of a kelp and shellfish nursery in Maine.”\n\nPaul continued: “$1.5 million to encourage video gaming in New York. … We might be better off spending 1.5 million to discourage kids from a playing video games. … $388,000 for Columbia University … $249,000 for the Baltimore Symphony, give money to all the symphonies.”\n\nRamaswamy appeared on Sunday Morning Futures and previewed plans for DOGE to completely “delete” some government agencies.\n\nHe said in part:\n\nOver the last 40 years, even conservatives, we’ve talked a big game for 40 years about cutting the federal government, about reducing the scope of the federal government. Politicians haven’t been able to do it. And so Elon and I, we’re not politicians. We’re businessmen. We’re coming at it from the outside. Sometimes, if you go inside, you become native to the system.”\n\n“I applaud President Trump for setting this up for success. But I come back to the principle. In the early months, score quick wins through executive the action, show what can be done, and then I think we’ll lay the groundwork for Congress to have to take meaningful steps for the future,” he explained.\n\n“Let’s start with the fact that there is massive waste, fraud and abuse right now. Federal contractors are really exploiting the federal government. You could take haircuts across the board, and they would be no worse off for if it,” Ramaswamy continued, previewing “mass reductions” at federal agencies.\n\n“We expect certain agencies to be deleted outright. We expect mass reductions in force in areas of the federal government that are bloated,” he said.\n\n“We expect massive cuts of all federal contractors and others who are overbilling the federal government. So, yes, we expect all of the above,” he added.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) is among those who have pointed out that DOGE can start with cutting bureaucrats off.\n\n“Well, they can get rid of the bureaucrats, for sure. There’s certainly things that they can do on that front. But you know, as an example, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency. Congress created the Department of Education. Nothing says that they have to have 4,500 employees at the Department of Education,” he told Breitbart News Daily.\n\nThe post follows DOGE stating that they are looking for “high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.”"

        "content": "Kim Kardashian just introduced her fans to an exciting \"new friend.\"\nIn a video shared to her Instagram Story on Monday, November 18, Kardashian, 44, shared Tesla's latest innovation, the Optimus Bot, with her followers. The series of clips show the reality star interacting with the humanoid robot, which performed several tasks with impressive precision.\nIn a caption overlaid on the video, Kardashian wrote, \"meet my new friend,\" as she introduced the bot and demonstrated some of its abilities, which included completing the heart hands symbol with her and showing off some dance moves. The robot even mimicked jogging after Kardashian asked it what it would like to do next – a move it repeated several times – to which the SKIMS founder chuckled, \"that running move gets me.\"\nLater in the video, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians alum gave a peek at a gold version of the robot, mentioning only how one of the special edition version exists. Kardashian also shared a look at Tesla's new Cyber Cab – a sedan version of their Cyber Truck – only this car can drive itself.\nKardashian isn't the only celebrity to interact with the futuristic cyborg. The Optimus Bot made its debut during Tesla's \"We, Robot\" event in October, where the robots interacted with attendees such as rapper 2 Chainz – though it was later revealed that the robot was being controlled remotely by a Tesla employee.\nThe Optimus Bot has previously come under scrutiny as fans began comparing its design to the robots seen in the 2004 film I, Robot starring Will Smith. The resemblance sparked some controversy, with film's director, Alex Proyas, who called out Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, and his design choices on X (formerly known as Twitter). \"Hey Elon [Musk], can I have my designs back please?\" he wrote, referencing the similarities between the Optimus Bot and his movie's robots.\nMusk, 43, claimed that this technology would be \"the biggest product ever — of any kind,\" according to Fortune, and that the bots would be priced somewhere between $20 and $30K. Despite that, it's unclear if Kardashian purchased the Optimus Bot herself or received it as a gift.\nAbout the writer\nJane is an entertainment writer and social media manager based in the US specializing in viral trends and celebrity news. ...

        "content": "First lady of Brazil, Rosângela Lula da Silva, commonly referred to as “Janja,” swore at Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk over the weekend at a G20 event in which she called for the regulation of social media.\n\nBrazil is the host of this year’s annual G20 summit. G20 member nations are presently gathered in Rio de Janeiro for the two-day gathering.\n\nOn Saturday, the Brazilian first lady participated in Cria G20, a sideline weekend event that, according to its website, sought to connect digital creators, activists, and communicators to “discuss hunger, inclusion and the climate emergency.”\n\nJanja da Silva attended on Saturday and delivered a lengthy speech in which she called for the regulation of social media to help stop the spread of “false information” on the internet.\n\nAccording to Reuters, a ship’s foghorn sounded while she was speaking. She responded by joking that Musk was sounding the foghorn to drown out her speech.\n\n“I’m not afraid of you!” she said in Portuguese, before adding, “fuck you, Elon Musk” in English. The Brazilian first lady then reportedly looked towards influencer Felipe Neto and said, “You said fuck you, I can too,” to which the man responded, “You can, you should.”\n\nMusk responded on his social media site Twitter, first in a message that read simply “lol,” an internet acronym meaning “laugh out loud.” He then shared a comment reading, “they will lose the next election.”\n\nOver the past year Twitter and the Brazilian judiciary have been embroiled in a lengthy feud that started over Musk’s initial refusal to comply with censorship orders issued by Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Minister Alexandre de Moraes, resulting in Twitter’s roughly one-month-ban from Brazil in late August.\n\nDespite his initial refusal to comply, Musk ultimately caved and had Twitter comply with de Moraes’ censorship orders, paying some $1.8 million in fines before the service was ultimately restored in Brazil in early October.\n\nJanja da Silva claimed during her speech that de Moraes had been invited to participate in the weekend social event but could not attend due to security concerns after a man killed himself in a suicide attack outside of Brazil’s supreme court last week.\n\n“We invited Minister Alexandre de Moraes [but he didn’t come] because of what unbelievably happened in Brasilia this week, and the bigot there ended up killing himself with fireworks, but anyway? Incredible. We laugh, but it’s serious, people, it’s serious. Look what social networks do to people’s minds,” the Brazilian First Lady reportedly said.\n\nHours after his wife’s speech, Brazilian radical leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reportedly appeared to refer to his wife’s words — without directly mentioning her — in remarks at the G20’s Global Alliance Against Hunger, stressing that “we don’t have to insult anyone.”\n\n“I’d like to tell you that this is a campaign in which we don’t have to offend anyone, we don’t have to swear at anyone. We just need to outrage society, outrage the people who have won the right to eat, that we have to bring together those people who don’t have enough to eat,” Lula said.\n\nJanja, 58, is the 79-year-old Brazilian president’s third wife, having started a relationship in 2017. The two reportedly dated throughout Lula’s conviction and imprisonment on multiple charges of corruption. The relationship reportedly became public in May 2019, when Lula confirmed it to economist Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira during a prison visit. Lula would eventually reveal that Janja frequently visited him in prison and was included as “family” on the prison’s authorized visit registry.\n\nThe couple married in May 2022. The socialists threw a lavish nine-hour party at a luxury venue featuring high-end wines. Reports published at the time indicated that Lula had banned staff from using cellphones out of fear of images and footage from the party potentially leaking.\n\nLula’s previous wife, Marisa Letícia Casa, died in 2017 after a stroke. His first wife, Maria de Lourdes Ribeiro, died of hepatitis in 1971.\n\nChristian K. Caruzo is a Venezuelan writer and documents life under socialism. You can follow him on Twitter here."

        "content": "Kim Kardashian reminded the world just how selfish and tone deaf she can be by getting a Tesla robot as her new bestie.\n\nWhile the rest of us try to earn a living and keep up with the ever-increasing costs of life and war continues to erupt around the world, Kardashian took time out of her day to befriend a new, expensive piece of technology. She took to X on Monday with a video of herself making little heart shapes with her hands as the robot mimicked her actions. Does anyone really care to see her interact with her new machine? Not even for a second.\n\nIt’s unclear if Kardashian paid for the robot or if it was gifted or lent to her, but Elon Musk previously said the price tag on one of these would eventually reach the range of $20,000 to $30,000. The reality television maven is clearly bored out of her skull and trying to find new ways to stay relevant. There are probably so few humans that will tolerate her stories, so she found the next-best thing. She resorted to playing with expensive toys and all it did was remind me that she’s completely tone deaf and incredibly out of touch with reality.\n\nShe was clearly thrilled with herself as she engaged in one-way communication with the personal robot that Musk launched at his Tesla presentation in October. She waved to it and was excited about the quick hello wave the robot returned. She then asked it if it would complete a heart shape with her, and she formed half a heart with her hand as the robot did the same.

The poor robot was probably motioning for a way to get the hell away from Kardashian, but no such luck.\n\n“Meet my new friend 🦾🤖 @Tesla,” she wrote on X.

        "content": "Tesla has slashed the base monthly Model Y lease price – the latest of a series of incentives to help the automaker attempt to deliver a record number of vehicles this quarter.\n\nLast month, Tesla said that it still plans to be marginally up on deliveries this year despite being down for the first 9 months.\n\nIt would require the automaker to deliver a record number of more than 515,000 vehicles in Q4. That’s ~30,000 more vehicles than Tesla’s last record quarter, which was Q4 2023.\n\nOver the last few weeks, we have been reporting on a series of sale incentives that Tesla has put in place to make sure it has the demand to achieve this record quarter.\n\nIn Europe, it includes a year of free Supercharging and heavy discounts.\n\nIn the US, there are also good inventory discounts, 3 months of free Supercharger and FSD, FSD transfer, and more.\n\nAnd everywhere, Tesla is heavily subsidizing loans with lower interest rates.\n\nNow, if the subsidized loan payments aren’t doing for you, Tesla has another solution: lower leases.\n\nTesla updated its only configurator last night to slash the base lease price of the Model Y Long Range RWD, which is likely Tesla’s best-selling variant, by $50 per month:\n\nThat’s the same lease deal as a Model 3 Long Range RWD despite the Model Y costing $2,500 more if you outright purchase it.\n\nIt sounds like Tesla is directly subsidizing Model Y leases by $50 per month over 36 months.\n\nElectrek’s Take\n\nThat’s a significant discount. With Tesla’s frequent 0 to 1.5% APR deals over the last year, it generally made more sense to go with subsidized financing than a lease, which kept Tesla’s vehicle lease numbers well below the rest of the EV industry in the US.\n\nNow, this is starting to be a more than competitive deal.\n\nTesla is basically subsidizing the lease by $1,800 over 3 years. Since it’s only for the base Model Y, which is likely Tesla’s most popular model, the automaker is likely anticipating to have too many in inventory and plans to get rid of some of them with this deal by the end of the year.\n\nAt this point, with all the heavy discounting, I think it’s likely that Tesla could hit its goal of 515,000 vehicles in the quarter."

        "publish_date": "2024-11-18T18:58:51Z",
        "content": "Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software has been a subject of immense curiosity, excitement, and sometimes skepticism. Yet, the progress Tesla has made in developing and refining FSD is nothing short of remarkable. During a panel discussion on Hans Nelson’s YouTube channel titled Tesla’s Insane FSD Progress, Tesla experts and investors Hans Nelson, Herbert Ong, and Jeff Lutz discussed the latest FSD advancements, shedding light on the exponential improvements Tesla has achieved and the challenges that lie ahead.\n“Tesla has a really good ability to sort real-time issues as they come in from drivers,” said Herbert Ong. He praised the company’s data-driven approach, which has been instrumental in refining FSD at an unprecedented pace. With version 12.5.2.1 already deployed to 50,000 vehicles, Ong explained that Tesla’s responsiveness to user feedback has made their software continually better. “The progress is really good, and it’s interesting to see how quickly they’ve addressed things like abrupt stopping at yellow lights or hesitation at green lights—all things that drivers have been reporting,” Ong added.\nListen to our conversation on the exponential improvement of Tesla FSD!\nRecent Updates and What’s Next\nOne of the most notable milestones discussed during the panel was the full rollout of end-to-end highway driving to all AI Hardware 4 users, which is targeted for early next week. “They’ve enhanced stop smoothness, reduced the annoying weather notifications, and introduced various safety improvements,” said Jeff Lutz. Version 12.5.x continues to refine city driving, and Smart Summon has now been released to Europe, China, and other international markets—a testament to Tesla’s ambition to make their technology globally adaptable.\nHowever, Ong also touched on the elephant in the room: “There are some features that were planned for October, like the unpark, park, and reverse capabilities, which haven’t yet been fully rolled out.” He emphasized that although Tesla fell behind on these particular features, the sheer scale of the We Robot event, which took place in mid-October, might have been the reason for the delay. Despite some setbacks, Ong remarked, “Even if all of this gets pushed to December or January, the bigger picture is that these engineering problems have solutions, and Tesla will deliver.”\nHarnessing Data to Drive Improvement\nThe role of data cannot be overstated when it comes to Tesla’s FSD improvements. “The amount of information they’re getting from the fleet is pretty significant,” Lutz said. “We’re talking about roughly 50,000 vehicles on version 12.5.6, and when you have datasets this large, it becomes much easier to identify product performance and trends in real-time.” He explained that analyzing large data sets is crucial for understanding how the system is performing and where it can be improved. “When you’re dealing with millions of data points, you get a much clearer picture compared to smaller, more discrete datasets,” Lutz added.\nThis approach to iterative testing and data collection enables Tesla to identify issues quickly and adjust course where necessary, which has been a driving factor in their progress. “Tesla’s ability to validate these changes through large-scale data analysis really sets them apart,” noted Ong.\nHardware 4 and AI4: Unleashing New Capabilities\nTesla’s Hardware 4, coupled with the latest AI4 models, represents a significant leap forward in the company’s self-driving capabilities. “The AI4 hardware has not only a faster computer but also higher resolution cameras,” said Nelson. “Up until now, they’ve only been emulating Hardware 3 cameras, but now they’re taking the training wheels off and running AI4 in full native resolution.” This upgrade enables Tesla to fully leverage the compute power and higher-resolution imagery that AI4 offers over previous hardware versions.\nNelson also addressed a common concern among Tesla owners about Hardware 3’s ability to keep up with future software updates. “Management has mentioned that while they are developing at the cutting edge with AI4, they will eventually backport these improvements to Hardware 3,” Nelson explained. “There are millions of Hardware 3 vehicles on the road, which makes it worthwhile to compress the models and adapt them for the older platform.” He added that, if necessary, Tesla could retrofit the older vehicles with upgraded computers—a complex but feasible solution.\nImprovements in Version 13: The Next Leap\nVersion 13 of FSD is poised to make substantial improvements across the board. “They’ve already said that version 13 has a four-times increase in miles between necessary interventions compared to version 12.5.4,” Lutz pointed out. This version is expected to be delivered to internal customers imminently, with a wider rollout targeted around Thanksgiving. “Much like version 12, which took a while to reach a full rollout, version 13 is a huge leap and will be phased in over time,” said Nelson.\nThe panelists detailed several of the new features included in version 13, such as improved collision avoidance systems, enhanced traffic control responses, and even the ability to detect emergency vehicles through audio inputs. “One user actually showed that the car could see an emergency vehicle coming and moved to the shoulder—an impressive feature that speaks to the depth of the FSD system,” Nelson said.\nThese advancements also include significant improvements in AI architecture. “They’re scaling everything—three times the model size, 4.2 times the model context length, and five times the training compute,” Lutz explained. “It’s clear they’re throwing everything at improving FSD, using the much-expanded version of Cortex. This means bigger, better, and more advanced models that will continue to improve the performance of FSD.”\nChallenges of Scheduling and Development\nDespite the rapid pace of improvement, there are inherent challenges to developing a technology as complex as Tesla’s FSD. “This isn’t like upgrading iOS from version 16 to 17,” Lutz said. “We’re talking about entirely new capabilities that have never been done before, so the ability to schedule down to the day becomes extremely difficult.” He emphasized that Tesla is making progress at an impressive pace, especially when compared to previous versions of FSD. “They’re now converging on more predictable timelines, and the delay has narrowed to about a 30-day window, which is pretty impressive given the complexity,” Lutz added.\nA Global Push: Expanding FSD Beyond the U.S.\nAnother topic of interest during the panel was Tesla’s expansion of FSD capabilities to international markets. “Smart Summon has now been released globally, including Europe and China, even though FSD supervision isn’t yet fully approved in these regions,” said Ong. This move, he suggested, signals Tesla’s confidence that regulatory approvals are not far behind. “It’s easier to roll out these features in other regions once you already have them functioning elsewhere,” Nelson added.\nThe Exponential Path Ahead\nThe panelists were unanimous in their belief that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system is improving at an exponential rate. “They’re working through a punch list of engineering problems, and they’re getting it done,” said Nelson. “The continued upgrades in hardware, AI models, and the sheer amount of data they’re processing means that FSD is on an upward trajectory that’s going to be very difficult for competitors to match.”\nIn the near future, Tesla’s FSD system will be increasingly capable, reliable, and ubiquitous. As Ong concluded, “Even if there are delays, Tesla’s track record shows they will deliver. These are engineering problems with solutions, and Tesla is one of the few companies that have both the technology and the ambition to solve them.”\nWith the combined power of advanced AI, robust data collection, and continued investment in hardware, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving is poised to redefine what’s possible in autonomous driving—not just in the U.S., but globally. The road ahead may still have bumps, but it’s clear that Tesla is accelerating at full speed toward a future where cars truly drive themselves."

It was followed by Sonic Healthcare (+6.83%) and Block Inc (+6.25%).\nThe worst performing stock was Elders, which shed 9.49% to $7.71 a share. It was followed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals (-5.31%) and Pilbara Minerals (-5.18%).\nASX closes higher after touching record intra-day high\nTrading's finished on the ASX today, and the ASX200 index has settled on 8,374 points, up 73.80 points (+0.89%) on yesterday's close.\nKyle Rodd, a senior financial market analyst from Capital.com, had this to say about the behaviour of stocks today.\n\"The ASX200 experienced an unexpected mini-melt-up to push the index to record highs and above 8,400 points for the first time.\n\"The index was up by as much as 1.5%, with the move pushing every sector of the market higher.\n\"Tech stocks surged mostly due to a strong lead from Wall Street, which saw a rebound in US-tech shares. A rally in Technology One shares after it revealed a 15% jump in full year profits padded the day’s returns. Lower yields were also a part of the story and that augurs well for equities across the globe.\n\"However, the outsized gain by the ASX200 suggests this is a local quirk, with there no obvious impetus for such a powerful and broad-based move.\nCbus directors found 'fit and proper' after Deloitte review\nCbus says all existing and new directors on the Cbus board have satisfied a \"fit and proper persons test\" as part of an ongoing independent review being conducted by Deloitte at the direction of APRA (the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority).\nIt says under Commonwealth law, directors on the boards of superannuation funds such as Cbus have an ongoing obligation to satisfy a \"fit and proper persons test\" to evaluate whether they have appropriate skills, experience and knowledge, are honest and trustworthy, and have the personal integrity and independence of mind necessary to be effective guardians of members’ savings.\nIt says after applying the \"fit and proper persons test\" the Cbus board has now confirmed the appointment of three directors nominated by the CFMEU.\nThe CFMEU can nominate thre of the 14 positions on the board. Those confirmed are:\n- Paddy Crumlin — Paddy is currently the national president of the CFMEU\n- Jason O’Mara — Jason rejoins the Cbus board having previously served between January 2022 and August 2024. He is currently the general manager of operations at the Canberra Tradesman Union Club\n- Lucy Weber — Lucy is currently the director of legal and industrial programs in the national office of the CFMEU\nFormer NT deputy chief minister takes up role with fracking company Tamboran Resources\nNicole Manison has been hired by Tamboran Resources, a US-owned company operating in the NT with which her former government signed lucrative gas contracts.\nThe former NT deputy chief minister and mining minister will be Tamboran's new vice-president of government relations and public affairs.\nTamboran is operating in the Beetaloo Basin, a burgeoning fracking hub in the territory outback, which was previously subject to a moratorium by Ms Manison's Labor government.\nOur colleague Matt Garrick reports:\nThe lowest number of apartments approved since the 2008-09 financial crisis\nAnd more.\nThe ABS says Australia tends to have a higher proportion of new houses than other types of dwellings, and this increased further at the start of the pandemic, with approvals increasing 40.2% between 2019-20 to 2020-21.\nIt says the increase in the proportion of new houses was partly due to shorter lead times qualifying more easily for government stimulus in 2020 than larger apartment buildings, which require longer lead times for developing and commencing construction.\nThe number of apartments approved were flat from 2019-20 to 2022-23 and fell to just 29,470 approvals (18.1% of total new dwellings) in 2023-24.\nThis is the lowest number of apartments approved since the 2008-09 financial year, when 21,233 dwellings were approved.\nIt says this reflects the increasingly challenging conditions for apartment buildings owing to long lead times and high construction costs.\nTense moment with Woolies bosses (past and present) at ACCC inquiry\nWell we've just had a tense period in the ACCC inquiry with Woolworths CEOs past and present.\nThe ACCC's barrister Naomi Sharp SC has been trying to get to the heart of the concern voiced by some farmers that they're \"price takers\" from the major supermarkets.\nSharp went in first to ask former CEO Brad Banducci if farmers were at a disadvantage in price negotiations.\nThen she hit the current CEO with the same line of questioning.\nNaomi Sharp SC: Is it your evidence that Woolworths does not have superior bargaining power when it comes to price negotiations when it comes to fruit and vegetable suppliers?\nAmanda Bardwell: I think as we've shared this morning, we would agree that we play an incredibly important role in the fruit and vegetable market in Australia. And as Brad's just talked to, the reality of the way that that market works at the moment is supply and demand, and we make up roughly 25% of that when it comes to fruit and vege.\nNaomi Sharp SC: So does Woolworths have superior bargaining power to fruit and vegetable suppliers when it comes to price negotiations?\nAmanda Bardwell: I think we play a very important role but each individual circumstance is different in terms of the context in terms of what might have happened to each indivudal product and weather patterns.\nNaomi Sharp SC: I'm not going to leave this question until I get a square answer. Does Woolworths have a superior bargaining position in price negotiations as compared to the suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables?\nAmanda Bardwell: We provide the opportunity for fruit and vegetable suppliers to be able to access roughly 25% of total release of supply, which remains 80% of opportunity across a number of other retailers and wholesale markets as well. We play a really important role within that.\nNaomi Sharp SC: I appreciate Woolworths plays an important role. But I am asking about your understanding as the CEO of one of the largest single acquirers of fruit and vegetable in this country, does Woolworths have a superior bargaining position?\nAmanda Bardwell: I think I've already given my answer to that question.\nUnlike another time a Woolworths boss tried to talk around a yes or no question in the Senate, Ms Bardwell wasn't threatened with jail time.\nWhy housing construction costs increased during the pandemic\nAnd let's continue.\nThe ABS says the construction delays led to a large increase in the time from commencement to completion for new houses.\nThe average new house completion time for Australia increased 50% since September 2019, from 2.2 quarters (6 months, 3 weeks) to 3.3 quarters (9 months, 4 weeks) in June 2024.\nCompletion times in Western Australia increased the most, from 2.3 quarters (6 months, 4 weeks) in September 2019, to a high of 5.4 quarters (16 months, 1 week) in March 2024.\nIt says during the pandemic, construction demand increased significantly, coinciding with global supply chain disruptions, rising material and freight costs, and labour shortages.\nThese all contributed to the increased cost to build new homes.\nMany new houses are built with fixed price contracts, where the builder agrees to perform the work for a fixed sum. This meant during 2020-23, many builders had signed fixed price contracts for permits which were approved before demand and costs increased. The nature of these contracts and their impacts on builder margins further contributed to the challenging construction environment and the backlog of houses under construction.\nThe average cost to build is a lagged indicator of the current construction environment, as it is calculated based on houses which have completed, not those currently under construction.\nThe average cost of completed homes in Australia has risen from $345,410 in 2019-20 to $443,828 in 2023-24. Across this period, the average annual cost increase was 6.7%.\nAll states and territories experienced a cost increase over this 5-year period.\nThe highest growth rate in new house construction costs over this period was in Queensland, increasing from $312,857 in 2019-20 to $450,612 in 2023-24, an average annual increase of 9.9%.\nThe lowest cost growth rate can be observed in Western Australia, increasing from $316,846 in 2019-20 to $382,044 in 2023-24, an average annual increase of 5.2%. However, WA has the longest completion times of all states and territories which may contribute to a lagged increase in construction costs recorded.\nHome building through the pandemic (and its many problems)\nThe Bureau of Statistics has published some very good data today that looks at the state of our home building industry.\nIt says the conditions for residential building in Australia have changed considerably over the past 5 years.\nIt says following the end of a large expansion of apartment buildings in the mid-2010s, total sector approvals (174,528 dwellings) and commencements (172,959 dwellings) had, by 2019-20, on the eve of the pandemic, declined to their lowest annual level since 2013-14.\nBut they surged in the second half of the 2020-21 financial year following the introduction of record-low interest rates and government stimulus programs directed at home building.\nBut since 2020-21, dwelling approvals and commencements have fallen each year, coinciding with increasing interest rates and construction costs.\nSee the graph below:\nIt says the surge of commencements in June 2021 created an influx of new houses being built and moving through construction stages at the same time.\nThis led to competing demand and shortages for the same trades and materials, which caused construction delays.\nWith projects stalling at various stages of construction, new houses took longer to complete.\nExtreme weather events and construction industry insolvencies further added to the construction delays, leading to a bottleneck of houses under construction, which has started to ease through mid-2023.\nIt says dwellings under construction peaked in March quarter 2023 at 104,315 dwellings, which is 48.4% higher than the pre-pandemic record of 70,306 in June quarter 2018.\nSince then, there have been improvements in the trade and material supply, and lower approvals have led to less work in the under-construction pipeline.\nThe industry has gradually worked through the backlog of houses, resulting in a reduction in the number of private new houses under construction to 87,149 in June 2024.\nIt was a safe bet\nA mandatory pre-commitment gaming card was promised by the Tasmanian government in 2022, as a harm-minimisation measure.\nAfter months of speculation that the plan had been scrapped or watered down, the government has now revealed it has been delayed indefinitely.\nRead more:\nHESTA's reply\nHESTA has issued its own statement.\nIt says the median value of the adjustment will be around $17:\n\"HESTA has been in discussions with APRA around adjustments to the number of units some members acquired in certain investment options during the period of significant market volatility, arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020,\" a HESTA spokesperson said.\n\"Upon further analysis, HESTA has determined that an adjustment to the number of units issued at the time be made for some members.

APRA was concerned that:\n- HESTA’s decision-making processes for out-of-cycle revaluations of unlisted assets were not adequate for the deteriorating market conditions faced by superannuation trustees in March 2020; and\n- HESTA’s valuation decision in March 2020 was unfair to members who switched from an adjusted single sector options to unadjusted options within that week and members who were issued units in the unadjusted options during the relevant week. In one instance, a member who switched investments from the adjusted Choice options to the unadjusted MySuper option during the week in question was approximately $17,000 worse off.\n\"APRA has engaged extensively with HESTA on this matter, including supervision activities to oversee strengthening of HESTA’s policies and procedures around unlisted asset valuation decisions.\n\"APRA commenced a formal investigation into the issue in January 2024.\n\"In light of HESTA's decision to make payments to affected members to make them good, and improvements to HESTA’s valuation policies and procedures, APRA has decided to close its investigation without further action.\"\nGoogle could be forced to sell off Chrome browser: report\nSome big news brewing out of the US, with reports Google's internet browser Chrome could be split off from the tech giant.\nAccording to reports from Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the plans, the US Department of Justice will ask a judge to force Google to sell off Chrome.\nThe DOJ will also ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolised the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, the report said.\nGoogle controls how people view the internet and what ads they see in part through its Chrome browser, which typically uses Google search, gathers information important to Google's ad business, and is estimated to have about two-thirds of the global browser market.\nThe DOJ declined to comment. Google, in a statement from Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president, Google Regulatory Affairs, said the DOJ is pushing a \"radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,\" and would harm consumers.\nThe move would be one of the most aggressive attempts by the Biden administration to curb what it alleges are Big Tech monopolies.\nUltimately, however, the re-election of Donald Trump to the presidency could have the greatest impact over the case.\nTwo months before the election, Trump claimed he would prosecute Google for what he perceives as bias against him. But a month later, Trump questioned whether breaking up the company was a good idea.\nHere's more from Emilia Terzon on the \"existential threat\" Google is facing from the current legal challenges, and what a break up of the company could look like:\nWith Reuters\nYou've got a lot of thoughts about Woolies\nIs the ACCC just finding out that running Woolies isn’t like running a milk bar? These executives aren’t involved in the day-to-day negotiations with suppliers\n- Alex\nImagine complaining that you have to prove to Woolworths that you’re paying your staff properly. Crazy\n- Alex\nMakes sense that Woolies gets favourable prices through rebates given its size, right? This is economies of scale in action which enables lower prices for Woolies customers.\n- Alex\nTense round of questioning at ACCC over Woolworths 'rebates' on suppliers\nThe ACCC's inquiry has already heard from growers advocates, who say that when they invoice the big supermarkets, they agree to take \"rebates\" off their invoices that give the retailers a further discount off a final bill.\nRebates are a historical strategy employed by retailers.\nThis definition seems to explain it:\nRebates are amounts retailers charge suppliers for having the product in the listing base. Rebates are very general and they do not ensure specific performance or positioning for suppliers. They are more common in perishable or fresh departments but we do hear of them in grocery as well.\nListing fees are usually only for regional or national listings. Retailers do not charge these for products in their local program. Rebates are a percentage of supplier’s sales to the retailer, deducted before the supplier is paid. This is often in the 2-5% range and should be included in the amount suppliers count as trade spend.\nThe ACCC is now trying to work out how Woolworths assesses what prices it is paying its suppliers overall for goods, and how it calculates these \"rebates\" in the final cost of a good it pays to a supplier.\nAnd it hasn't been an easy line of questioning. It has been bandied around for the last 30 minutes between various Woolworths spokespersons before the ACCC inquiry, including a former MD.\nNaomi Sharp SC: \"You understand that rebates are an important source of income for Woolworths?\"\nNatalie Davis: \"I think I've answered that question.\"\nAre you a Coles, Aldi, Metcash or Woolworths supplier? Do you have an invoice that shows your \"rebate\" that you can confidentially send me? Any insight on what it does to your bottom line and what you ultimately get off a retailer?\nI'm on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au or em.terzon@proton.me.\nRBA still in 'wait and watch' mode\nAbhijit Surya from Capital Economics says following the release of the RBA Board minutes, he's sticking with his view that the RBA won't begin cutting rates before the second quarter of 2025 (April, May or June next year).\nHe's circulated a note with some thoughts:\n\"Although the Board acknowledged that underlying inflation was moderating, it was doing so at a very gradual pace,\" he said.\n\"Members characterised underlying inflation as still being “too high” and reiterated their view that it was unlikely to return sustainably to target until 2026. Additionally, the minutes stated that “given the already lengthy period in which inflation had been above target, the Board has minimal tolerance to accommodate a more prolonged period of high inflation.\n\"To be sure, the Board also discussed scenarios in which monetary policy would need to be looser than it is currently. In that regard, the ongoing weakness in consumption growth could potentially see the Board shift towards an easing bias in the coming months.\n\"However, for the moment, we think concerns about the tightness of the labour market and the weakness in productivity outcomes will take greater precedence for the Bank. After all, by the Board’s own admission, the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply is still positive.\n\"The upshot is that we continue to believe the RBA won’t loosen policy before Q2 next year.\n\"Moreover, we only expect 75bp worth of cuts over the coming easing cycle.\n\"As Assistant Governor Kent pointed out in a speech yesterday, despite the prevalence of variable-rate mortgage debt in the economy, monetary policy in Australia is not more potent than in peer economies. That means, having hiked rates less than most other advanced economy central banks, the RBA now has less scope to provide interest-rate relief without stoking inflation,\" he said.\nWill interest rates stay higher for longer in Australia as a consequence of Donald Trump's election?\nThe minutes of the Reserve Bank Board's recent meeting have just been released.\nOur colleague, Senior Business Correspondent Peter Ryan, has sent across this summary to the blog:\nMajor changes in US economic policy have been cited as a potential risk to the Reserve Bank's stance in keeping interest rates higher for longer to combat persistent inflation.\nIn the minutes from the RBA board's meeting a fortnight ago, the central bank considered risks that could have \"important implications for monetary policy\" that could result in forecasts being \"materially wrong\".\nThese include \"major changes in the US economic policy following the presidential election\" and the possibility that stimulus proposed by Chinese authorities to breathe life into its economy might \"differ from expectations\".\nThe Reserve Bank board met on November 4 & 5 before the outcome of the US presidential election was known.\nUS President-elect Donald Trump threatened throughout his campaign to impose tariffs on goods coming into America by as much as 20%, and 60% on Chinese goods.\nEconomists believe Mr Trump's policies if implemented could stoke inflation and discourage central banks from cutting interest rates.\nHowever, while the minutes do not reveal any war-gaming about scenarios, members warn that would need to occur if the risks eventuated despite the \"pertinent details .. being unknown and unpredictable\".\n\"The implications for the Australian economy of the scenarios with limited global reaction could ultimately be quite modest because of the potential for trade flows to be redirected,\" the minutes say.\nBut the minutes noted that whatever the outcome, US fiscal deficits are forecast to be large making sovereign debt \"more sensitive to adverse shocks over time\".\nThe RBA board also considered scenarios where its stance to keep interest rates on hold at 4.35% would need to be revised.\nThese include a dramatic decline in consumption where spending was \"persistently and materially weaker\" than forecast which would warrant a reduction in the cash rate.\nThe Board also considered a rapid decline in the labour market where \"conditions eased materially and more sharply than expected\" in turn lowering inflation.\nOne scenario being considered by the RBA is firms that are \"hoarding\" labour could be forced to \"unwind\" or lay off staff by not filling vacancies.\n\"If forward looking indicators begin to suggest a widespread easing in retrospective labour market conditions and a more rapid easing in inflation, the Board might need to consider a policy response.\"\nHowever in leaving the cash rate on hold at 4.35%, the Board said it had \"minimal tolerance to accommodate a more prolonged period of high inflation.\"\nMarket economists who had originally suggested February for the first interest rate cut are now pencilling-in May at the earliest.\nThe Reserve Bank board holds it final meeting of the year on December 10.\nBunnings breached privacy laws by using facial recognition on customers, commissioner finds\nRetail giant Bunnings has breached privacy laws by using facial recognition technology on its customers, according to a landmark finding by the Privacy Commissioner.\nToday's decision is the result of a two-year investigation by the regulator.\n\"Individuals who entered the relevant Bunnings stores at the time would not have been aware that facial recognition technology was in use and especially that their sensitive information was being collected, even if briefly,\" Australian Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind said.\nThe case is expected to have major implications for how Australian businesses use the technology in future.\n\"Facial recognition technology, and the surveillance it enables, has emerged as one of the most ethically challenging new technologies,\" Commissioner Kind said.\nThe Privacy Commissioner found Bunnings interfered with the privacy of hundreds of thousands of customers across 63 of its New South Wales and Victorian stores, between November 6, 2018 and November 30, 2021.\nThe regulator said Bunnings did not gain proper consent to use the technology on them.\nRead more of the breaking story here:"

It was followed by Sonic Healthcare (+6.83%) and Block Inc (+6.25%).\nThe worst performing stock was Elders, which shed 9.49% to $7.71 a share. It was followed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals (-5.31%) and Pilbara Minerals (-5.18%).\nASX closes higher after touching record intra-day high\nTrading's finished on the ASX today, and the ASX200 index has settled on 8,374 points, up 73.80 points (+0.89%) on yesterday's close.\nKyle Rodd, a senior financial market analyst from Capital.com, had this to say about the behaviour of stocks today.\n\"The ASX200 experienced an unexpected mini-melt-up to push the index to record highs and above 8,400 points for the first time.\n\"The index was up by as much as 1.5%, with the move pushing every sector of the market higher.\n\"Tech stocks surged mostly due to a strong lead from Wall Street, which saw a rebound in US-tech shares. A rally in Technology One shares after it revealed a 15% jump in full year profits padded the day’s returns. Lower yields were also a part of the story and that augurs well for equities across the globe.\n\"However, the outsized gain by the ASX200 suggests this is a local quirk, with there no obvious impetus for such a powerful and broad-based move.\nCbus directors found 'fit and proper' after Deloitte review\nCbus says all existing and new directors on the Cbus board have satisfied a \"fit and proper persons test\" as part of an ongoing independent review being conducted by Deloitte at the direction of APRA (the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority).\nIt says under Commonwealth law, directors on the boards of superannuation funds such as Cbus have an ongoing obligation to satisfy a \"fit and proper persons test\" to evaluate whether they have appropriate skills, experience and knowledge, are honest and trustworthy, and have the personal integrity and independence of mind necessary to be effective guardians of members’ savings.\nIt says after applying the \"fit and proper persons test\" the Cbus board has now confirmed the appointment of three directors nominated by the CFMEU.\nThe CFMEU can nominate thre of the 14 positions on the board. Those confirmed are:\n- Paddy Crumlin — Paddy is currently the national president of the CFMEU\n- Jason O’Mara — Jason rejoins the Cbus board having previously served between January 2022 and August 2024. He is currently the general manager of operations at the Canberra Tradesman Union Club\n- Lucy Weber — Lucy is currently the director of legal and industrial programs in the national office of the CFMEU\nFormer NT deputy chief minister takes up role with fracking company Tamboran Resources\nNicole Manison has been hired by Tamboran Resources, a US-owned company operating in the NT with which her former government signed lucrative gas contracts.\nThe former NT deputy chief minister and mining minister will be Tamboran's new vice-president of government relations and public affairs.\nTamboran is operating in the Beetaloo Basin, a burgeoning fracking hub in the territory outback, which was previously subject to a moratorium by Ms Manison's Labor government.\nOur colleague Matt Garrick reports:\nThe lowest number of apartments approved since the 2008-09 financial crisis\nAnd more.\nThe ABS says Australia tends to have a higher proportion of new houses than other types of dwellings, and this increased further at the start of the pandemic, with approvals increasing 40.2% between 2019-20 to 2020-21.\nIt says the increase in the proportion of new houses was partly due to shorter lead times qualifying more easily for government stimulus in 2020 than larger apartment buildings, which require longer lead times for developing and commencing construction.\nThe number of apartments approved were flat from 2019-20 to 2022-23 and fell to just 29,470 approvals (18.1% of total new dwellings) in 2023-24.\nThis is the lowest number of apartments approved since the 2008-09 financial year, when 21,233 dwellings were approved.\nIt says this reflects the increasingly challenging conditions for apartment buildings owing to long lead times and high construction costs.\nTense moment with Woolies bosses (past and present) at ACCC inquiry\nWell we've just had a tense period in the ACCC inquiry with Woolworths CEOs past and present.\nThe ACCC's barrister Naomi Sharp SC has been trying to get to the heart of the concern voiced by some farmers that they're \"price takers\" from the major supermarkets.\nSharp went in first to ask former CEO Brad Banducci if farmers were at a disadvantage in price negotiations.\nThen she hit the current CEO with the same line of questioning.\nNaomi Sharp SC: Is it your evidence that Woolworths does not have superior bargaining power when it comes to price negotiations when it comes to fruit and vegetable suppliers?\nAmanda Bardwell: I think as we've shared this morning, we would agree that we play an incredibly important role in the fruit and vegetable market in Australia. And as Brad's just talked to, the reality of the way that that market works at the moment is supply and demand, and we make up roughly 25% of that when it comes to fruit and vege.\nNaomi Sharp SC: So does Woolworths have superior bargaining power to fruit and vegetable suppliers when it comes to price negotiations?\nAmanda Bardwell: I think we play a very important role but each individual circumstance is different in terms of the context in terms of what might have happened to each indivudal product and weather patterns.\nNaomi Sharp SC: I'm not going to leave this question until I get a square answer. Does Woolworths have a superior bargaining position in price negotiations as compared to the suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables?\nAmanda Bardwell: We provide the opportunity for fruit and vegetable suppliers to be able to access roughly 25% of total release of supply, which remains 80% of opportunity across a number of other retailers and wholesale markets as well. We play a really important role within that.\nNaomi Sharp SC: I appreciate Woolworths plays an important role. But I am asking about your understanding as the CEO of one of the largest single acquirers of fruit and vegetable in this country, does Woolworths have a superior bargaining position?\nAmanda Bardwell: I think I've already given my answer to that question.\nUnlike another time a Woolworths boss tried to talk around a yes or no question in the Senate, Ms Bardwell wasn't threatened with jail time.\nWhy housing construction costs increased during the pandemic\nAnd let's continue.\nThe ABS says the construction delays led to a large increase in the time from commencement to completion for new houses.\nThe average new house completion time for Australia increased 50% since September 2019, from 2.2 quarters (6 months, 3 weeks) to 3.3 quarters (9 months, 4 weeks) in June 2024.\nCompletion times in Western Australia increased the most, from 2.3 quarters (6 months, 4 weeks) in September 2019, to a high of 5.4 quarters (16 months, 1 week) in March 2024.\nIt says during the pandemic, construction demand increased significantly, coinciding with global supply chain disruptions, rising material and freight costs, and labour shortages.\nThese all contributed to the increased cost to build new homes.\nMany new houses are built with fixed price contracts, where the builder agrees to perform the work for a fixed sum. This meant during 2020-23, many builders had signed fixed price contracts for permits which were approved before demand and costs increased. The nature of these contracts and their impacts on builder margins further contributed to the challenging construction environment and the backlog of houses under construction.\nThe average cost to build is a lagged indicator of the current construction environment, as it is calculated based on houses which have completed, not those currently under construction.\nThe average cost of completed homes in Australia has risen from $345,410 in 2019-20 to $443,828 in 2023-24. Across this period, the average annual cost increase was 6.7%.\nAll states and territories experienced a cost increase over this 5-year period.\nThe highest growth rate in new house construction costs over this period was in Queensland, increasing from $312,857 in 2019-20 to $450,612 in 2023-24, an average annual increase of 9.9%.\nThe lowest cost growth rate can be observed in Western Australia, increasing from $316,846 in 2019-20 to $382,044 in 2023-24, an average annual increase of 5.2%. However, WA has the longest completion times of all states and territories which may contribute to a lagged increase in construction costs recorded.\nHome building through the pandemic (and its many problems)\nThe Bureau of Statistics has published some very good data today that looks at the state of our home building industry.\nIt says the conditions for residential building in Australia have changed considerably over the past 5 years.\nIt says following the end of a large expansion of apartment buildings in the mid-2010s, total sector approvals (174,528 dwellings) and commencements (172,959 dwellings) had, by 2019-20, on the eve of the pandemic, declined to their lowest annual level since 2013-14.\nBut they surged in the second half of the 2020-21 financial year following the introduction of record-low interest rates and government stimulus programs directed at home building.\nBut since 2020-21, dwelling approvals and commencements have fallen each year, coinciding with increasing interest rates and construction costs.\nSee the graph below:\nIt says the surge of commencements in June 2021 created an influx of new houses being built and moving through construction stages at the same time.\nThis led to competing demand and shortages for the same trades and materials, which caused construction delays.\nWith projects stalling at various stages of construction, new houses took longer to complete.\nExtreme weather events and construction industry insolvencies further added to the construction delays, leading to a bottleneck of houses under construction, which has started to ease through mid-2023.\nIt says dwellings under construction peaked in March quarter 2023 at 104,315 dwellings, which is 48.4% higher than the pre-pandemic record of 70,306 in June quarter 2018.\nSince then, there have been improvements in the trade and material supply, and lower approvals have led to less work in the under-construction pipeline.\nThe industry has gradually worked through the backlog of houses, resulting in a reduction in the number of private new houses under construction to 87,149 in June 2024.\nIt was a safe bet\nA mandatory pre-commitment gaming card was promised by the Tasmanian government in 2022, as a harm-minimisation measure.\nAfter months of speculation that the plan had been scrapped or watered down, the government has now revealed it has been delayed indefinitely.\nRead more:\nHESTA's reply\nHESTA has issued its own statement.\nIt says the median value of the adjustment will be around $17:\n\"HESTA has been in discussions with APRA around adjustments to the number of units some members acquired in certain investment options during the period of significant market volatility, arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020,\" a HESTA spokesperson said.\n\"Upon further analysis, HESTA has determined that an adjustment to the number of units issued at the time be made for some members.

But a month later, Trump questioned whether breaking up the company was a good idea.\nHere's more from Emilia Terzon on the \"existential threat\" Google is facing from the current legal challenges, and what a break up of the company could look like:\nWith Reuters\nYou've got a lot of thoughts about Woolies\nIs the ACCC just finding out that running Woolies isn’t like running a milk bar? These executives aren’t involved in the day-to-day negotiations with suppliers\n- Alex\nImagine complaining that you have to prove to Woolworths that you’re paying your staff properly. Crazy\n- Alex\nMakes sense that Woolies gets favourable prices through rebates given its size, right? This is economies of scale in action which enables lower prices for Woolies customers.\n- Alex\nTense round of questioning at ACCC over Woolworths 'rebates' on suppliers\nThe ACCC's inquiry has already heard from growers advocates, who say that when they invoice the big supermarkets, they agree to take \"rebates\" off their invoices that give the retailers a further discount off a final bill.\nRebates are a historical strategy employed by retailers.\nThis definition seems to explain it:\nRebates are amounts retailers charge suppliers for having the product in the listing base. Rebates are very general and they do not ensure specific performance or positioning for suppliers. They are more common in perishable or fresh departments but we do hear of them in grocery as well.\nListing fees are usually only for regional or national listings. Retailers do not charge these for products in their local program. Rebates are a percentage of supplier’s sales to the retailer, deducted before the supplier is paid. This is often in the 2-5% range and should be included in the amount suppliers count as trade spend.\nThe ACCC is now trying to work out how Woolworths assesses what prices it is paying its suppliers overall for goods, and how it calculates these \"rebates\" in the final cost of a good it pays to a supplier.\nAnd it hasn't been an easy line of questioning. It has been bandied around for the last 30 minutes between various Woolworths spokespersons before the ACCC inquiry, including a former MD.\nNaomi Sharp SC: \"You understand that rebates are an important source of income for Woolworths?\"\nNatalie Davis: \"I think I've answered that question.\"\nAre you a Coles, Aldi, Metcash or Woolworths supplier? Do you have an invoice that shows your \"rebate\" that you can confidentially send me? Any insight on what it does to your bottom line and what you ultimately get off a retailer?\nI'm on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au or em.terzon@proton.me.\nRBA still in 'wait and watch' mode\nAbhijit Surya from Capital Economics says following the release of the RBA Board minutes, he's sticking with his view that the RBA won't begin cutting rates before the second quarter of 2025 (April, May or June next year).\nHe's circulated a note with some thoughts:\n\"Although the Board acknowledged that underlying inflation was moderating, it was doing so at a very gradual pace,\" he said.\n\"Members characterised underlying inflation as still being “too high” and reiterated their view that it was unlikely to return sustainably to target until 2026. Additionally, the minutes stated that “given the already lengthy period in which inflation had been above target, the Board has minimal tolerance to accommodate a more prolonged period of high inflation.\n\"To be sure, the Board also discussed scenarios in which monetary policy would need to be looser than it is currently. In that regard, the ongoing weakness in consumption growth could potentially see the Board shift towards an easing bias in the coming months.\n\"However, for the moment, we think concerns about the tightness of the labour market and the weakness in productivity outcomes will take greater precedence for the Bank. After all, by the Board’s own admission, the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply is still positive.\n\"The upshot is that we continue to believe the RBA won’t loosen policy before Q2 next year.\n\"Moreover, we only expect 75bp worth of cuts over the coming easing cycle.\n\"As Assistant Governor Kent pointed out in a speech yesterday, despite the prevalence of variable-rate mortgage debt in the economy, monetary policy in Australia is not more potent than in peer economies. That means, having hiked rates less than most other advanced economy central banks, the RBA now has less scope to provide interest-rate relief without stoking inflation,\" he said.\nWill interest rates stay higher for longer in Australia as a consequence of Donald Trump's election?\nThe minutes of the Reserve Bank Board's recent meeting have just been released.\nOur colleague, Senior Business Correspondent Peter Ryan, has sent across this summary to the blog:\nMajor changes in US economic policy have been cited as a potential risk to the Reserve Bank's stance in keeping interest rates higher for longer to combat persistent inflation.\nIn the minutes from the RBA board's meeting a fortnight ago, the central bank considered risks that could have \"important implications for monetary policy\" that could result in forecasts being \"materially wrong\".\nThese include \"major changes in the US economic policy following the presidential election\" and the possibility that stimulus proposed by Chinese authorities to breathe life into its economy might \"differ from expectations\".\nThe Reserve Bank board met on November 4 & 5 before the outcome of the US presidential election was known.\nUS President-elect Donald Trump threatened throughout his campaign to impose tariffs on goods coming into America by as much as 20%, and 60% on Chinese goods.\nEconomists believe Mr Trump's policies if implemented could stoke inflation and discourage central banks from cutting interest rates.\nHowever, while the minutes do not reveal any war-gaming about scenarios, members warn that would need to occur if the risks eventuated despite the \"pertinent details .. being unknown and unpredictable\".\n\"The implications for the Australian economy of the scenarios with limited global reaction could ultimately be quite modest because of the potential for trade flows to be redirected,\" the minutes say.\nBut the minutes noted that whatever the outcome, US fiscal deficits are forecast to be large making sovereign debt \"more sensitive to adverse shocks over time\".\nThe RBA board also considered scenarios where its stance to keep interest rates on hold at 4.35% would need to be revised.\nThese include a dramatic decline in consumption where spending was \"persistently and materially weaker\" than forecast which would warrant a reduction in the cash rate.\nThe Board also considered a rapid decline in the labour market where \"conditions eased materially and more sharply than expected\" in turn lowering inflation.\nOne scenario being considered by the RBA is firms that are \"hoarding\" labour could be forced to \"unwind\" or lay off staff by not filling vacancies.\n\"If forward looking indicators begin to suggest a widespread easing in retrospective labour market conditions and a more rapid easing in inflation, the Board might need to consider a policy response.\"\nHowever in leaving the cash rate on hold at 4.35%, the Board said it had \"minimal tolerance to accommodate a more prolonged period of high inflation.\"\nMarket economists who had originally suggested February for the first interest rate cut are now pencilling-in May at the earliest.\nThe Reserve Bank board holds it final meeting of the year on December 10.\nBunnings breached privacy laws by using facial recognition on customers, commissioner finds\nRetail giant Bunnings has breached privacy laws by using facial recognition technology on its customers, according to a landmark finding by the Privacy Commissioner.\nToday's decision is the result of a two-year investigation by the regulator.\n\"Individuals who entered the relevant Bunnings stores at the time would not have been aware that facial recognition technology was in use and especially that their sensitive information was being collected, even if briefly,\" Australian Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind said.\nThe case is expected to have major implications for how Australian businesses use the technology in future.\n\"Facial recognition technology, and the surveillance it enables, has emerged as one of the most ethically challenging new technologies,\" Commissioner Kind said.\nThe Privacy Commissioner found Bunnings interfered with the privacy of hundreds of thousands of customers across 63 of its New South Wales and Victorian stores, between November 6, 2018 and November 30, 2021.\nThe regulator said Bunnings did not gain proper consent to use the technology on them.\nRead more of the breaking story here:"

And with fewer roadblocks in place, investors are clearly giddy at the prospect of Tesla unleashing its autonomous vehicles on the world.\n\nThat's despite some glaring shortcomings with Tesla's self-driving tech, leading to hundreds of collisions and plenty of terrifying close calls, as well as several investigations by federal regulators.\n\nRed Light\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Trump's transition team is looking to staff its Transportation Department with employees willing to create a framework surrounding the regulation of self-driving vehicles.\n\nHowever, whether Trump's picks will be able to fully open the floodgates remains to be seen. Any major revisions to self-driving car rules will still require bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nBut given Musk's proximity to Trump, the Tesla CEO has plenty of incentive to push for more lax rules. Alphabet's Waymo has already cemented itself as the autonomous ride-hailing service to beat, with General Motors' Cruise falling off following a fateful collision and a disastrous year.\n\nAnd Musk is aiming high, having shown off an early prototype for a steering-wheel-less \"Cybercab\" during a flashy event earlier this year. Waymo's current fleet still features both pedals and steering wheels.\n\nBut nagging safety concerns have slowed progress considerably. Case in point, a bill to increase the number of deployments of self-driving cars, which is currently limited to just 2,500 vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, stalled in Congress.\n\nIn other words, the Trump administration will have to play its cards carefully to open doors for Musk — and the question of what Trump feels he really owes Musk looms larger than ever.\n\nMore on self-driving cars: \"Self-Driving\" Cars Have a Dirty Secret"

He’s already getting on Donald Trump’s nerves, users are abandoning X in favor of Bluesky, and just anecdotally, I’ve never seen a Cybertruck in the wild without also seeing someone laugh at it. Luckily for Musk, Kim Kardashian is a maverick. Why wouldn’t she post about hanging out with a Tesla robot right now?\n\nThe way she says, “Oh, you are Hawaiian” when the robot does hula arms will be stuck in my head for the next month.\n\nIn a longer version of the video she posted to her Instagram Story (where just yesterday she devoted several stories to a recipe she found on X … interesting) Kardashian made heart hands with the robot, taught it to blow a kiss, and played rock, paper, scissors. She does not seem to be filled with fear, which is how I imagine most people would feel when confronted with a real-life version of the villain from every movie about the future.\n\nMusk unveiled the humanoid robot, called Optimus, last month at a Tesla event. He told the crowd that Optimus would be able to “be a teacher, babysit your kids, walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries, just be your friend … Whatever you can think of, it will do.” Kardashian’s model doesn’t seem like it’s ready to take care of children or comprehend a grocery list, but let’s give it some time. I’m sure with a few software updates it will be capable of all that and teaming up with its robot brothers to take over Calabasas.\n\nStay in touch.

The work is at an early stage and policy details have yet to be fleshed out.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption. It also has a number of ongoing safety investigations into both autonomous vehicles and driver-assistance systems, including features Tesla markets as Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.\n\nWhile the Transportation Department can set narrow rules through NHTSA that would help clear a path for autonomous vehicles, mass adoption of self-driving cars likely will require a broader act of Congress. A bipartisan legislative measure that’s at the early-discussion stage would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.\n\n“The companies want clarity on vehicles with no pedals and no steering wheel,” said Grayson Brulte, founder of The Road to Autonomy, a data and analysis firm focused self-driving technology. “There could be a fight over this, but if a federal framework is implemented, it could usher in the autonomy economy.”\n\nOne candidate for Transportation Secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, according to people familiar with the discussions. Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.\n\nThe transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nWaymo, Cruise\n\nTesla is trying to catch up to companies led by Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo that, unlike Musk’s automaker, have already been ferrying riders around in vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.\n\nWaymo and General Motors Co.’s Cruise have to this point largely only deployed autonomous cars that still have steering wheels and pedals, despite their ability to operate without a human in the driver’s seat. This is due to state and federal safety requirements, many of which were written long before the advent of automated-driving systems.\n\nWhile companies can apply for an exemption from those standards to deploy a limited number of vehicles without certain controls, Cruise’s petition for one wasn’t acted upon for more than two years. In July, GM announced it was abandoning plans for a dedicated autonomous vehicle called the Origin.\n\nAutonomous vehicles also have deployed slowly because of safety issues. Cruise pulled its cars off the road for almost a year after one of its vehicles struck and dragged a pedestrian in San Francisco. NHTSA also has launched defect investigations into Waymo and Amazon.com Inc.’s Zoox unit, as well as Tesla’s driver-assistance systems. Uber sold off its self-driving car division in 2020, years after one of its test vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.\n\nTesla’s Cybercab\n\nMusk announced plans last month to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis starting as soon as 2026. The company unveiled Cybercab and Robovan models last month that were merely prototypes.\n\nSoon after the event, Musk called for a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. During Tesla’s quarterly earnings call, the CEO said he’d leverage a potential role in the Trump administration to push for one.\n\nTrump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.\n\nRelated Articles National Politics | Bernie Sanders and Democrats attempt to block some weapons for Israel over Gaza deaths\n\nBernie Sanders and Democrats attempt to block some weapons for Israel over Gaza deaths National Politics | Speaker Johnson declares support for banning Sarah McBride’s access to women’s restrooms\n\nSpeaker Johnson declares support for banning Sarah McBride’s access to women’s restrooms National Politics | Ukraine will get U.S. landmines as part of $275 million aid package\n\nUkraine will get U.S. landmines as part of $275 million aid package National Politics | Disregard Michael Wolff’s ‘nonsense’ new book, Trump team warns\n\nDisregard Michael Wolff’s ‘nonsense’ new book, Trump team warns National Politics | Massachusetts looks to gain new sanctuary city, debate expected in Natick Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have fizzled.\n\nNHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.\n\nA bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.\n\n(With assistance from Keith Laing, Hadriana Lowenkron, Craig Trudell, Emily Chang and Ted Mann.)\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTesla is offering three months of free Supercharging and FSD to customers taking deliveries in 2024.\n\nThe incentives come as Tesla tries to meet its goal of delivering a record number of cars this year.\n\nThe possible end of the $7,500 EV tax credit under Trump could also motivate buyers.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying a Tesla, now may be a good time.\n\nElon Musk is looking to deliver a record number of Teslas by the end of the year, so the car company is increasing its incentives with less than two months to go in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EV giant is offering three months of free Supercharging and its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) beta software to customers who take delivery of a new inventory Tesla in North America by December 31. FSD usually costs $8,000.\n\nTesla is offering three months of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and Supercharging to customers who take delivery of new inventory vehicles by December 31. screenshot/Tesla\n\nIt's important to note this doesn't mean you automatically get the incentives if you custom order a new Tesla.\n\n\"New inventory vehicles\" refer to Teslas that are already built and ready to be delivered. The banner on Tesla's website says used vehicles and business orders are excluded from this deal, and the offer can't be postponed to a later date. So if you kit out a Tesla model that isn't built in time for you to take delivery this year, you're out of luck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla added the new promotion as it looks to make good on its guidance that it will grow vehicle deliveries this year. In its third-quarter earnings, Tesla predicted it would end the year with \"slight growth in vehicle deliveries\" despite a challenging landscape.\n\nThe EV maker delivered about 1,294,000 vehicles as of the third quarter and ended 2023 with 1.81 million total deliveries. If Tesla wants to beat last year's delivery numbers, that means it would need to deliver over 516,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo analysts previously said they expect Tesla to offer \"aggressive finance promos globally\" this quarter.\n\nTesla's latest offerings aren't the first time the EV maker has offered incentives to new buyers. In July, it offered three months of free Supercharging for buyers taking delivery of any Model S, 3, X, or Y by August 15. In August, Tesla introduced a $5,000 three-year bundle for its Model S and Model X, offering an FSD-supervised subscription, Supercharging, and premium connectivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother incentive that may work in Tesla's favor is the looming possibility that the US may rescind the $7,5000 federal tax credit awarded to those who purchase new EVs. Trump is reportedly planning to get rid of the tax credit, a benefit introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act. Musk has seemingly voiced his support, writing online: \"End all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas.\"\n\nThe threat of rising EV prices could push some would-be EV buyers to pull the trigger on a new Tesla before Trump takes office. Tesla's additional incentives simply sweeten the deal."

Sam Graves, R-Mo., outgoing Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., and Fox News host Sean Duffy, a former Republican House member from Wisconsin, Reuters said, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n© Copyright IBTimes 2024.

        "content": "Tesla’s top battery cell supplier, CATL, is throwing some cold water on Tesla’s battery plans and the CEO even said that Elon Musk “doesn’t know how to make battery cells.”\n\nContemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) had an incredible rise and became the world’s largest producer of battery cells for electric vehicles in the last few years – and by a significant margin.\n\nIt even supplies Tesla with many battery cells for its EV production at Gigafactory Shanghai.\n\nCATL’s success has made Robin Zeng, its founder and chairman, one of the foremost authorities on battery cell production, which makes his new comments on Tesla’s battery cell production effort interesting.\n\nTesla buys most of its batttery cells from suppliers, inlcuding CATL and Panasonic, but it has also launched its own effort to produce its own cylindical 4680 battery cells, which are currently only used in the Cybertruck.\n\nThe company has had issues ramping up production of its own battery cells, but it reported making progress lately – going as far as claiming that its own cell will achieve better cost than anyone in the industry by the end of the year.\n\nBut CATL is not impressed.\n\nZeng spoke to Reuters recently and reported that he had a discussion with Musk earlier this year when he visited China. The CATL founder warned Musk that he thinks Tesla’s 4680 effort will fail:\n\nZeng said he had told Musk directly that his bet on a cylindrical battery, known as the 4680, “is going to fail and never be successful.”\n\nThe CATL founder, who has a PhD in physics, was also unimpressed with Musk’s electrochemistry knowledge when debating Tesla’s 4680 batteyr cell effort:\n\n“We had a very big debate, and I showed him,” Zeng said. “He was silent. He doesn’t know how to make a battery. It’s about electrochemistry. He’s good for the chips, the software, the hardware, the mechanical things.”\n\nIn this interview, Zeng was very candid about his chat with Musk. He even touched on Musk’s notirous issues with timelines.\n\nHe commented:\n\n“His problem is overpromising. I talked to him,” Zeng said. “Maybe something needs five years. But he says two years. I definitely asked him why. He told me he wanted to push people.”\n\nThis has been the excuse that many Musk fans have been using to justify his missed timelines: he is trying to motivate his troups.\n\nElectrek’s Take\n\nI am surprised that the head of a supplier would talk about the CEO of one of his main customers like that.\n\nObviously, he is biased since Tesla’s battery effort could cut into his business, but at the same time, Tesla has always made it clear that they would always need to keep buying from battery suppliers.\n\nI think what is most interesting here is that CATL’s expertise is in LFP cells and we know that Tesla is looking to make its own LFP cells at one point. That might be what Zeng is talking about here.\n\nWith that said, Tesla did claim that it is on the verge of accomplishing its cost target with the 4680 cell. It might be true, but I have issues believing some of the things Tesla claims these days."

Was it a great car? Not really. Should Nissan be commended for giving it a shot? Absolutely.

Personally, I would argue the problem was that the buying public was simply too foolish or shortsighted to see the beauty that is a crossover with a convertible roof.

There’s no telling how long it will last, but the photos show it both up and down, and a broken top is also missing from the “Known Flaws” section.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you just want a CrossCab, you should be able to find a cheap one fairly easily. Finding one with a working top, though? Good luck with that. Unfortunately for you, if you’re the kind of weirdo who would absolutely buy this car, you don’t have much time left to bid. There are less than 24 hours before this auction is over, and I fully expect a bidding war toward the end that might even cross the $10,000 mark. To the right person, though, this thing will be absolute gold."

Promotion is subject to change at any time.\n\nThis appear to be part of Tesla’s effort to deliver a record number of more than 515,000 vehicles in Q4 in order for its annual deliveries not to be down for the full year.\n\nver the last few weeks, we have been reporting on a series of sale incentives that Tesla has put in place to make sure it has the demand to achieve this record quarter.\n\nIn Europe, it includes a year of free Supercharging and heavy discounts.\n\nIn the US, there are also good inventory discounts, 3 months of free Supercharger and FSD, FSD transfer, and more.\n\nAnd everywhere, Tesla is heavily subsidizing loans with lower interest rates.\n\nBut it’s the first time that Tesla is using such a targeted incentive, at the state level, and using its Tesla Electric program.\n\nIt’s interesting."

        "content": "Tesla has evidently given an exclusive look at its Optimus robot and its new Cybercab to none other than Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe reality TV star has long owned Tesla vehicles, but she has been more public about her ownership of Tesla vehicles since the Cybertruck.\n\nWe previously reported that she possibly had the first painted Cybertruck.\n\nNow, Tesla has brought her a couple of Optimus humanoid robots and a Cybercab for an exclusive demo that she shared on her Instagram stories:\n\nThe Optimus robot did some of the same tricks that it did at Tesla’s ‘We, Robot’ event, though we know that those robots were remotely operated at the time.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be anything new on that front – although Tesla did bring her a gold Optimus.\n\nKardashian seemed impressed with the Cybercab as well and even gave congrats to Tesla’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen. She praised the “rims”, which include painting the side of the tires gold.\n\nIt’s unclear if Tesla paid Kardashian for her Instagram stories sent to her hundreds of millions of followers.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has long claimed that the automaker doesn’t do any favoritism with celebrities or pay for their endorsements, but we have seen signs that it is changing.\n\nEspecially with the Cybertruck, many celebrities appeared to have had priority deliveries and more recently, Tesla hired its first celebrity ambassador.\n\nElectrek’s Take\n\nI think this is Tesla now. Look, if they didn’t pay for it, good for them. It’s free publicity. Anyone would take it, but giving an exclusive look at Optimus and Cybercab to literally only Tesla’s own shareholders (at the We, Robot event) and now Kim Kardashian says a lot about the company right now.\n\nTesla is not letting tech reviewers and journalists test out those products because they would get panned. They are far from ready, but as usual, Tesla still wants the hype from them.\n\nThat’s why you go to Kardashian, who generally posts about clothing, jewelry, and makeup. You can’t expect her to analyze robustness of Tesla’s humanoid robots or the potential of the Cybercab to actually achieve better than human driving capabilities."

        "content": "Investors are all abuzz right now on the news that Donald Trump will make it easier to get autonomous cars on the roads. Tesla stock shot up on the news, and Wall Street analysts justified the jump by saying much of the company’s value is based on its AI efforts. Here’s the issue: The analysts are wrong, and autonomous cars are not the market godsend they’re expecting.\n\nIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video It's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions\n\nIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish It's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions\n\nCNBC spoke with analyst Tom Narayan of RBC Capital yesterday, to ask whether Trump’s promise to deregulate autonomous vehicles would outweigh his promise to end the federal EV tax credit. Narayan had previously written on the topic when raising RBC’s target price for Tesla, saying that autonomy accounts for a full 77 percent of the company’s valuation. He told CNBC that AV deregulation would far outweigh the tax credit in importance, as it would allow Tesla to create a vehicle “without wheels and pedals” that “cuts down a lot of costs” and can “gobble up the market.” The problem Narayan doesn’t see, however, is that cutting wheels and pedals won’t save that much cost — and that the self-driving market is far smaller than most think.\n\nSelf-driving justifies Tesla’s market cap more than car sales, says RBC’s Tom Narayan\n\nFirst off, the cost savings from removing wheels and pedals from cars would likely be nearly negligible in comparison to the cost of an autonomous vehicle. Sure, brake master cylinders and steering columns are complicated, but AVs still need to brake and steer — the complex systems remain in place, with only the human controls removed to save money. According to Tesla’s parts fiche, the entire upper steering column and wheel assembly for a Model S costs just $2,853.05 at retail pricing. Nothing to sneeze at, sure, but not even enough to outweigh the $2,400 car computer. Controls aren’t the big money sinks in automotive manufacturing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there’s the AV market, which is more dire than analysts think. The entire global passenger car market sat at about $3.1 trillion in 2022. Studies have shown that 86 percent of U.S. drivers want to be able to take over an autonomous car in the event of an emergency, meaning that every AV manufacturer is only playing for a slice of a $434 billion pie if those numbers hold up globally. Add in Tesla’s master plan to allow Robotaxi owners to share their vehicles, which could allow a single vehicle sale to cover multiple interested buyers, and the company’s piece of that already tiny market could end up infinitesimal. For context, no automaker currently holds more than an 11 percent market share globally — Tesla could well be playing for mere tens of billions here. That doesn’t justify 77 percent of a trillion-plus-dollar market cap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, AV sentiment varies by location, and applying U.S. attitudes towards autonomy towards the entire global market is an oversimplification for this example. Chinese car buyers are more open to autonomy than we are over here, while folks in India hew closer to our American opinions. But even if that total AV market doubles or triples in size, it’s not enough to justify the sort of investment we’re seeing. Autonomous vehicles are not a source of infinite income with minimal cost waiting just around the corner, locked away by federal regulation — they’re a niche interest that most people won’t buy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 11/19/2024 3:02 PM: Fixed math errors resulting from punching a typo into my calculator. The theoretical size of the AV market is $434 billion, not million, meaning an 11 percent market share would net out to about $4.8 billion — still well short of 77 percent of Tesla’s $1.08 trillion market cap, which comes out to $831.6 billion, and that’s based on a future in which Tesla achieves Toyota-like dominance over the AV category. While the passenger car market is growing at 16.2 percent annually, it would still take years for the entire market size to match that share of Tesla’s market cap, let alone for the company’s own market share to match that amount. Plus, without AVs on the roads and on sale, it’s tough to say what growth may look like for that market."

        "content": "Pete Davidson? Kanye West? Step aside. Kim Kardashian’s new beaux is a Tesla bot named Optimus.\n\nThe fashion mogul got some hands-on experience with Tesla’s bipedal, humanoid robot, which is not yet available to the general public. In Kardashian’s videos with the robot — posted to X and her Instagram story — she prompts Optimus to make a heart with its hand (unlike Kim, Optimus is not wearing massive bling), dance like it’s at a luau, and play rock, paper, scissors.\n\nThen she joins a one-of-a-kind gold version of the robot to sit inside Tesla’s Cybercab, a two-passenger autonomous vehicle that CEO Elon Musk says will begin production in 2027. However, even Musk admitted that he’s not always realistic with his timelines — after all, he predicted in 2019 that Tesla would have a million robotaxis on the road within a year. It has been nearly five.\n\nTesla flaunted its Optimus robots at its We, Robot event last month, and while the event was flashy, the robots that greeted guests on the ground were not autonomous: They were controlled by humans. So, it’s likely that Kardashian’s experience with Optimus was mediated by humans as well.\n\nKardashian’s videos don’t show any actual driving in the Cybercab, but she describes the vehicle as “insane” and “crazy.” Musk hasn’t responded directly to Kardashian’s videos, but he retweeted one of them on X.\n\nKardashian didn’t flag the videos as being sponsored — something that is legally mandated for influencers to disclose —but we know she has already bought into the Tesla sphere. She owns a Cybertruck, though TMZ says she was recently pulled over because her front window was tinted too dark. Maybe Optimus can help her fix that."

The wrapping service, which is designed to protect paintwork on cars from chips or rust that might be picked up in daily drives, has been removed from the Tesla site after being sold out since January.\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Tesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish Tesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nThe Cybertruck wrapping service kicked off in December 2023 and promised to offer a layer of protection on the electric truck for the low, low price of $6,000. The optional wrap could be ordered in 11 colors and sold out almost as soon as it went on sale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince January 2024, it’s been impossible to spec a Cybertruck with the factory wrap and now Tesla has officially removed the option from its website, reports Inside EVs:\n\nEver since the Tesla Cybertruck debuted as a prototype back in 2019, Tesla and its rather outspoken CEO, Elon Musk, made a couple of things clear. One of those things was that the angular-shaped electric pickup’s stainless steel body didn’t need any protection. That includes paint. “No paint, no chips,” as per Tesla’s website. So when the AI and robotics company started selling factory-installed paint protection film, some eyebrows were raised among the community, especially since the product’s description on Tesla’s online shop read clearly: “Protects against scratches.” Well, at least it used to read that, because the factory wrap service is dead, as spotted by Drive Tesla Canada. It’s not exactly a tear-filled event, seeing how the various colored wraps have been mostly out of stock since January, according to the automaker’s website seen through the Wayback Machine. But removing the service entirely from the web – the shop page no longer exists – can mean several things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla reportedly ran into supply chain issues with the wrap, which used a urethane-based film rather than the traditional vinyl that’s used to wrap many models, adds Motor1. Tesla claimed that the wrap was “self-healing” and twice as thick as other wraps, however Inside EVs reports that the advantages of the wrapping tech were countered by issues “somewhere along the supply chain.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose supply chain issues are just one reason Tesla may have canned the wrapping service, with Inside EVs adding that it could have been scrapped as a result of limited demand, both for the wraps and for the trucks themselves. In recent weeks, it’s been getting increasingly easy to order a brand new Cybertruck direct from Tesla, with wait times now down to as little as a week after the automaker worked through its “millions” of pre-orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith fewer and fewer people buying the trucks, it wouldn’t make sense for Tesla to dedicate an area of its factory to wrapping them when it could be using the space for more important things.\n\nWraps such as this have also come under fire in recent weeks after one Cybertruck owner found issues when removing vinyl stickers from his gargantuan EV."

The system will have a capacity of 200 MW/800 MWh – enough to power around 45,000 homes for four hours during peak electricity demand. The batteries will absorb excess energy when customer demand is lower and store it for use during peak demand. It’s expected to come online in 2025. Plus, the Flatland project will save more than 169 million gallons of water each year compared to traditional energy generation.\n\nThis is SRP and EDPR NA’s second collaboration – the Flatland project will sit within Brittlebush Solar Park, their previous project, which already supplies 200 MW of solar power to SRP customers. The location means the battery can store energy from both the solar park and the grid.\n\nThe Flatland project will also boost the local economy. With a capital investment of over $271 million, the project will pay $7 million in taxes to local governments and support small businesses throughout its lifetime.\n\nBobby Olsen, SRP’s chief planning, strategy, and sustainability executive, pointed out that energy storage is crucial for SRP’s decarbonization goals. “Battery energy storage is an essential piece of SRP’s plan to decarbonize our portfolio and maximize the amount of renewable energy delivered to our customers,” Olsen said.\n\nSRP wants to slash carbon emissions by 82% from 2005 levels by 2035 and achieve net zero by 2050. The utility, which is moving forward with the planned retirement of 1,300 MW of coal resources, currently has nearly 1,300 MW of storage and almost 3,000 MW of carbon-free resources online, and it expects to reach 50% net zero by 2028.\n\nRead more: Arizona’s largest battery will help feed your Google habit\n\nIf you live in an area that has frequent natural disaster events, and are interested in making your home more resilient to power outages, consider going solar and adding a battery storage system.

She asked the robot to mimic the arm movements of a runner. The robot then began hula dancing and asked if she could blow a kiss. After showing the robot how to do it and instructing it to lift its hand to the face, it successfully reciprocated the gesture.Kardashians star, 44, also asked the robot to simulate running before lifting its hand to the height of its head. The Skims co-founder responded that Kardashian is tall and stays fit by running.The robot then played a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, with Kardashian counting to three before she held out scissors and the android flashed paper.Fans online poked fun at the single celeb, with one congratulating Kim on finding the ultimate low-maintenance boyfriend!

        "description": "New iPhones and Teslas come with an insatiable demand for lithium and other 'critical metals.'\nThe post ‘Everything has a cost:’ High-tech products and the new era of mineral mining appeared first on Popular Science.",
        "link": "https://www.popsci.com/environment/lithium-mining/",
        "publish_date": "2024-11-19T16:24:32Z",
        "content": "Late last month, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management granted approval for a massive new lithium mine in the Nevada desert, the start of what could foretell a rapid ramp-up of domestic mining for so-called “critical minerals” in the coming years. When the plant comes online, it’s expected to produce enough lithium to help power the batteries of 370,000 electric vehicles every year. Though an impending Donald Trump administration seems poised to roll back many EV and climate change initiatives, the need for particularly coveted metals—which include copper, cobalt, and nickel—supersedes politics. Critical metals are at the core of the iPhone, Teslas, and countless other high-tech products. Global demand for these metals is expected to rapidly increase by 400-600 percent in the next few decades.\n\nBut there’s a problem brewing. All this rapid new demand for metals and the products they power may be outpacing the available supply. That means domestic mining operations, which have a long history of dealing devastating environmental damage and displacing communities, are about to get a lot more common. Governments and businesses rushing to extract as many of these resources from the Earth as quickly as possible risk further polluting the planet. Ironically, these metals are also crucial to building the wind turbines and solar panels being built to stave off a future climate disaster.\n\nThese are some of the dilemmas journalist Vince Beiser wrestles with in his new book, Power Metal: The Race For the Resources That Will Shape The Future. Beiser provides a stark account of the mind-bending amounts of extracted resources that will be needed to fuel what he’s calling the coming “Electro-Digital Age.” To illustrate that, Beiser travels to several sources of production, including a lithium mine baking in Chile’s Atacama desert. The experience of mine workers and nearby residents there at times overlap in meaningful ways with the planned mine in Nevada. The book notably isn’t arguing that a renewables-first approach isn’t worth pursuing. Rather, Beiser uses shocking forecasts and first-hand experience in active mining areas to serve as a wake-up call for what to expect moving forward.\n\n“Everything has a cost,” Beiser writes. “There are no solutions, no technologies, no social or economic developments that bring only benefits. Every development, however positive, also has some kind of downside.”\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. Email address Sign up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n‘Minerals don’t fall from the sky. They are ripped from the Earth.’\n\nAn increasingly high-tech global economy will require far more critical metals than are currently being produced. To put it in perspective, Beiser notes that a single smartphone can contain up to two-thirds of all the elements on the periodic table. At some point, these elements had to be extracted, or as is often the case, blasted out of the Earth.\n\nBeiser estimates as much as seventy-five pounds of copper ore have to be pulled from the ground in order to build one single-four and half-ounce iPhone. A single Tesla Model S electric vehicle, by comparison, requires as much lithium as roughly ten thousand iPhones. The Biden administration and other governments around the world have set targets of having half of all new cars sold be electric by 2030. Carmakers are already charging ahead, which means millions more of these resource intensive EVs will be hitting roads, not in decades, but several years.\n\nMore of these metals will be needed to produce the many wind turbines and solar panels that will come to dominate a global economy increasingly powered by renewable energy sources. Even if a Trump administration reverses course on climate initiatives in the US, the global trend towards renewables and away from fossil fuels has already been set in motion. After decades of false starts and setbacks, renewable energy sources currently account for nearly a quarter of the electricity in the US according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Solar and wind capacity alone are expected to double by 2027. By that same year, the IEA estimates renewables will be the single greatest source of electricity worldwide.\n\n[ Related: What’s the most sustainable way to mine the largest known lithium deposit in the world? ]\n\nAll of that hinges on more metals being extracted from the ground. The IEA estimates the world will need ten times as much lithium by 2050 to meet renewable energy demands. By around that same time, annual demand for copper could be greater than the total amount used worldwide between 1900 and 2021. Global demand for minerals broadly is expected to increase 400-600 percent in the next few decades. Whether or not we can collectively meet that demand isn’t entirely certain.\n\n“We might not have enough metals to build wind turbines, solar panels, and electric cars as quickly as we need in order to keep the world from warming to the point after which climate change could become truly cataclysmic,” Beiser writes.\n\nThe environmental toll of lithium\n\nAlthough a minority of new startups are experimenting with innovative new chemical processes to extract lithium directly from rock, the vast majority of mining for the resource now uses more traditional brine mining techniques, which requires vast amounts of water and can take a toll on local ecologies. In Argentina, lithium mining operations have already reportedly contaminated streams used to irrigate crops. In China, a lithium mine reportedly polluted a nearby river so badly that it killed the fish who lived in it and the yaks that drank its water. Mining, regardless of the target resource, generally leaves a lasting mark on its land source and the people responsible for extraction. In the US the EPA estimates that 40% of all US watersheds have already been contaminated by various forms of hardrock mining.\n\nThose are just a few of the worrisome outcomes activists in Nevada are fighting to avoid. A recent lawsuit attempting to reverse the mine’s government approval alleges the operation would endanger various sites deemed sacred to the Indigenous, Western Shoshone people. One of those areas includes a place called Cave Spring, which the suit describes as “a site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.” The bulk of the lawsuit, however, argues the mine would wind up decimating the local Tiehm’s buckwheat population, a delicate, six-inch-tall wildflower with cream and yellow blooms that only grow in that area. It is currently listed as an endangered species.\n\nIoneer, the Australian-based mining company tasked with running the project, has said it plans to “vigorously defend” its approval. As for the Buckwheat, the company maintains it is taking necessary steps to ensure its operation can coexist with the plants. If all does go according to plan, Ioneer says it intends to start breaking ground on the mine in the stretch of desert between Reno and Las Vegas next year. Under that timeline, the mind should be fully operational by 2028.\n\nIn both Chile and Nevada, these environmental stressors directly end up impacting already disadvantaged Indigenous groups. Beiser visited villages of Atacama people living in the foothills not far from the lithium mines. Those villagers rely on nearby streams and runoff from the Andes mountains to grow their food. Locals reportedly told the author the mine’s massive water consumption already meant there was less available for them to use for farming. Those claims tend to track with a 2019 study from Arizona State University researchers which found soil moisture and vegetation had declined in the areas near the salt mines between 1997 and 2017. That’s around the same period lithium mines there quadrupled in size.\n\n“Here, again, is the familiar conundrum,” Beiser writes. “The spread of digital technology and electric vehicles will ultimately benefit most places, but the heaviest costs of this shift are being paid by only some people and some places.”\n\nCritical mineral extraction may still less harmful than gas and coal\n\nSupporters of expanded mining for critical minerals argue this approach, as extractive as it may be, is still far more palatable than an alternative future powered by dirty fossil fuels. An analysis released earlier this year by a prominent environmental research center called the Breakthrough Institute compared various types of mining operations and found that mining associated with wind and solar still had a much smaller environmental footprint than those tied to coal or natural gas. Generating just one gigawatt-hour of electricity with coal is reported to require 20 times the mining footprint as the same amount of electricity generated by solar or wind.\n\nOther, more experimental efforts are also being considered to meet soaring mineral demand. Beiser highlights several startups currently investing millions into controversial, “deep sea mining” which involves scrapping the mineral deposits from the seabed at depths greater than 200 meters. Geological surveys have shown those deep seabeds remain virtually untapped and are rich with copper, nickel, aluminum, manganese, zinc, lithium, and other metals. Opponents of this approach worry the process of essentially stripping the ocean floor could deal significant and irreversible damage to marine diversity and ecosystems. Other “space mining” startups, some with the financial backing of prominent tech leaders like Larry Paige, are exploring ways to one day extract minerals and metals from the thousands of asteroids orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. Those moonshot efforts, though admittedly eye-catching, are unlikely to actually gain traction anytime soon.\n\nGet ready for more mines in more places\n\nAll of that points to a reality where mines like the one being contested in Nevada become much more common in the future. It’s not all bad news. Experts are cautiously optimistic innovations in battery tech could make future iterations powering vehicles far more efficient and less resource-intensive than the current generation. Advances in lithium-ion battery recycling simultaneously mean future EVs may be able to source a sizable chunk of their necessary metals and components from older, phased-out models. On a societal level, government leaders in the US and Europe say new domestic mining operations could add many needed jobs to shaky economies and help diversify global supply chains. Still, it’s almost guaranteed a wave of new critical minerals would put pressure on environments and the communities that reside near them.\n\nAll of these approaches, from new mines to deep sea excavation, are rooted in the same underlying assumption: humans will keep consuming more and more resources. That doesn’t necessarily need to be the case. Governments and individuals could shift attitudes away from cheap, dispensable consumer goods. Technicians and mechanics empowered by right-to-repair laws could extend the lives of phones and other resource-intensive electronics rather than have them disposed of on a yearly basis. In general, the most surefire way to sidestep the need for a new age of extractive mining might be simply to use less and prevent the demand from manifesting in the first place. Unfortunately, all signs seem to suggest that the train has left the station.\n\n“Maintaining the same level of consumption is impossible,” Chilean scientist and microbiologist Cristina Dorador told Beiser. “We need to change the way that we live on Earth.”"

It’s often compared to big overwrought machinery from the annals of science fiction, compared to something from “Blade Runner,” “Aliens,” or “Robocop.” Company CEO Elon Musk likes to mention the Cybertruck in reference to his absurdist desire to colonize Mars. The fact is, this hulking behemoth can barely handle surviving the real-world streets of a highly developed nation. This one couldn’t even handle a year in Seattle.\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Tesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish Tesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nThe Seattle Cybertruck, an erstwhile Google Maps tourist attraction location, made the rounds on social media back in September, inspiring “fans” to erect a gravestone for the fallen, leave flowers nearby and hold candlelight vigils in its honor. Meanwhile, the illegally parked broken machine was hit with the orange windshield sticker of doom, letting the owner know the city was going to tow it away if it stayed there much longer. By the end of the day on September 10th, it was gone. Now it has resurfaced as an auction listing on the home of junked cars, Copart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the vehicle’s original price being around $100,000, and the total damage looking not all that bad, Copart estimates the value of this Cyberjunk to be just $31,156. It isn’t clear what happened here, but there’s obviously some rear suspension damage. Did the owner skid into a curb and shove the rear axle into the electric motor, scattering the whole thing into a million pieces? There’s not enough here to go off of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would imagine you could get some serious coin by dismantling this thing and selling the parts on eBay, because parts to repair other Cybertrucks are both difficult to come by, and expensive directly from Tesla. If you could use the parts of this buffalo to keep other Cybertrucks on the road, you could single handedly make the world a worse place, and make some money doing it.\n\nThis is still listed as an “upcoming lot” so it isn’t available for bidding quite yet. Check back in a few days for your opportunity to own the world’s worst piece of lawn art."

In addition to gaining more driving range, here’s what the new model includes.\n\nAfter introducing the GV70 three years ago, the SUV is already the most popular Genesis vehicle in North America.\n\nLast March, Genesis launched the all-electric Electrified GV70 in the US. The electric SUV was the first Hyundai Motor Group electric vehicle made in the US after production started in Alabama last February.\n\nLess than two years later, it’s already due for an update. The 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 gains more range and sleek new styling. It even comes with an NACS port for charging at Tesla Superchargers.\n\nGenesis North America COO Claudia Márquez said the newly designed Electrified GV70 offers “all of the utility and interior refinement of a great SUV” without sacrificing the signature Genesis drive.\n\nThe front bumper features a redesigned G-Matrix Crest Grille and microlens array (MLA) headlamps, as well as the unmistakable Genesis two-line headlamps. It also features bigger air intakes, adding to its already sporty look.\n\n2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 update (Source: Genesis)\n\nGenesis Electrified GV70 gains more range, NACS port\n\nGenesis added newly designed 19″ and 21″ wheel options.

Genesis also improved the vehicle’s voice commands.\n\n2026 Genesis GV70 and Electrified GV70 interior (Source: Genesis)\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the added NACS port upfront so drivers can charge at Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network. The 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 will have access to over 36,000 NACS and CCS DC fast chargers, double the number available to current EV drivers.\n\nPowered by a larger 84 kWh battery (up from 77.4 kWh), the updated 2026 model will also offer more range.

        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy are taking a page out of Amazon’s playbook and pushing for federal workers to return to the office five days per week, as part of their appointed task force to review government spending under President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nAs Trump’s chosen leaders of the anticipated Department of Government Efficiency — which will operate outside of the government — Musk and Ramaswamy said they will eliminate remote work for government employees, even if it means some staff quitting.\n\nSEE ALSO: Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch Appointed NYPD Commissioner\n\n“Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the COVID-era privilege of staying home,” they wrote in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.\n\nIf their plan is approved, the return-to-office mandate would apply to more than 2 million federal workers across the country — 80 percent of whom work outside of Washington, D.C., Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe announcement comes after D.C. officials have long pushed outgoing President Joe Biden to bring workers back into the office due to high office vacancy rates and stagnant economic activity in the nation’s capital, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBy the end of 2023, regional office vacancy in the D.C. metro area increased 100 basis points year-over-year and reached 21.8 percent during the fourth quarter, as Commercial Observer previously reported.\n\nWhile Musk and Ramaswamy’s announcement would likely reduce the city’s office vacancy rate, there could be significant backlash from labor unions on the return-to-office mandate, as many federal employees are unionized, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThis isn’t Musk’s first push to get rid of working from home. Shortly after acquiring social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Musk announced in November 2022 that all staffers at the company would be expected to work in the office at least 40 hours per week. He also made a similar edict to Tesla employees.\n\nSeveral other tech giants have since followed suit, including Amazon (AMZN), which said in September that office workers must return to their desks five days per week starting in 2025, and Salesforce, whose employees must work in the office at least four days per week as of October.\n\nIsabelle Durso can be reached at idurso@commercialobserver.com."

        "content": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump have spent time together just about every day since the election. The pair has addressed lawmakers in Washington, D.C., sat ringside at a UFC fight in New York City, and attended a rocket launch in South Texas.\n\nInvestors appear to have taken notice. Shares of Musk-run Tesla have soared nearly 40% since Trump won re-election nearly two weeks ago. But the electric carmaker is not the only company affiliated with a Trump ally that has enjoyed a stock surge in the aftermath of Trump's victory.\n\nApollo Global Management, an investment firm whose CEO, Marc Rowan, is said to be under consideration for Treasury secretary, as first reported by The New York Times, has seen its share price jump more than 12%.\n\nLikewise, Palantir, a data analytics firm founded by longtime Trump backer Peter Thiel, has undergone a rise of 23% since Election Day.\n\nGEO Group, a private prison company, made a $500,000 contribution to a pro-Trump Super PAC, while two top executives at the company, Brian Evans and George Zoley, each made personal donations in support of Trump. The company’s shares have skyrocketed 87% since the election.\n\nThe stock value of the companies noted has far outpaced the S &P 500. That index has climbed about 2.5% since Election Day.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for comment, nor did Apollo Global Management, Palantir, or GEO Group.\n\nTom Essaye, president of financial data firm Sevens Report Research, said the strong gains for a range of stocks affiliated with Trump allies indicate a view among some investors that Trump will reward friends with favorable treatment.\n\n“The market is incredibly sensitive to try to capture any edge in any stock that it can possibly find,” Essaye told ABC News. “This is absolutely a reflection of people’s perception of Trump.”\n\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment.\n\nA new presidential administration typically bodes well for some industries and worse for others, depending on the policy priorities of an incoming president, experts told ABC News. Trump has touted policy proposals widely viewed as pro-business, such as loosened regulations and an extension of the signature tax cut measure enacted during his first term.\n\nA portion of the increase in share price for some of the Trump-connected firms may stem from that overall shift toward business-friendly policy, some experts said.\n\n\"It’s not unusual for stocks to go up in sectors that look like the new administration will be more favorable to them than past policy has been,\" Tom Rogers, the founder of CNBC, told ABC News.\n\nHowever, the price jump for specific stocks tied to Trump allies also marks an altogether different trend that arises from the view of Trump as a transactional leader who may face fewer guardrails during a second term, Rogers said.\n\n“You have the new layer with Trump where he tends to be someone who can favor companies or disfavor companies based on his view of their politics or his view of their level of support for him,” Rogers added. “It’s natural that the market will take those factors into account.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, some top CEOs have appeared to seek improved relations with Trump.\n\nDays before this year's election, Jeff Bezos, the executive chairman of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, blocked the newspaper’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. In an op-ed for the newspaper addressing the decision, Bezos said, “no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here.” Bezos did acknowledge that the decision could present \"the appearance of conflict\" of interest.\n\nIn the days following the election, Trump received congratulatory messages from Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, among other top executives.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks with Dana White during UFC 309 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Nov. 16, 2024. Brad Penner/Reuters\n\nIt's also possible that Tesla might suffer under the Trump administration. The president-elect has sharply criticized the electric vehicle industry and vowed to eliminate a subsidy made available to those who purchase an electric car. Still, Tesla’s stock price has climbed alongside Musk’s emergence as a close advisor to Trump, including being selected as the co-lead of a new government efficiency commission.\n\n“The fact that Elon Musk is so close to the administration – and, in fact, will be in the administration in some capacity – suggests that for all the talk, his companies won’t be hurt,” Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan who studies market activity, told ABC News.\n\nA slew of other Trump allies have seen their firms make gains since the election.\n\nTKO Group Holdings is the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is led by CEO Dana White, who addressed Trump supporters at the Republican National Convention as well as the rally at Madison Square Garden last month. Shares of TKO Group holdings have climbed more than 10% since Trump’s victory.\n\nA spokesperson for TKO Group Holdings declined to respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nSteve Schwarzman, a Republican megadonor who endorsed Trump in May, leads asset management giant Blackstone. Shares of the company have jumped about 9% in value since Election Day. Energy Transfer, an energy pipeline company whose Executive Chairman Kelcy Warren donated $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, has seen its share price increase more than 6% over the past two weeks.\n\nNeither did Blackstone nor Energy Transfer immediately responded to ABC News requests for comment.\n\nTo be sure, some businesses with ties to Trump or his allies have seen their shares decline in value since the election. The stock price of Las Vegas Sands, a casino owned by Trump megadonor Miriam Adelson, has dropped about 2% over the past two weeks. Trump-owned Truth Social has seen shares decline more than 13% since Election Day.\n\nSome experts told ABC News that the surge for some companies with connections to Trump may soon fizzle out.\n\n“The first time that somebody who supposedly was in good favor with the Trump administration doesn’t get something their corporate interests are looking for, the air may come out of these things,” Rogers said. “For the time being, it’s probably a logical bet.”\n\nSeyhun, of the University of Michigan, agreed. “This initial buying is very much a fear of missing out,” he said."

Perfect response.\n\nAs of this writing, the post had gained 2,200 upvotes. Further, Snopes readers sought to confirm the claim in repeated searches, asking if Musk had indeed made this accusation against Scott.\n\nThe claim is correct. In an X post dated March 6, 2024, Musk accused Scott of being a reason \"Western Civilization died.\"\n\nAs Snopes reported in March 2024, Scott is an outspoken philanthropist who said she intended to give away her fortune.

He was replying to another X post, also deleted but preserved in the internet archive, that listed the causes to which Scott had focused on donating, according to the list on her website:\n\n(X/@eyelasho)\n\nWho is Bezos' ex giving money to? According to her fund's website, over half of the orgs to which she's donated so far deal with issues of race and/or gender. Her fund ought to be called The AWFL Fund. It's the ultimate aspirational expression of the most awful group in the US.\n\nMusk Had Criticized Scott Before\n\nThis was not the first time Musk spoke out against Scott. In May 2022, he also criticized her for her philanthropic efforts, accusing her of donating to Democrats, whom he perceived were attacking Tesla (archived):\n\nTrue. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil & gas industry. The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie's donation to PACs posing as charities.\n\nIn the same exchange, he then suggested Scott was turning on all tech industry moguls so as to retaliate against her ex-husband, Bezos (archived):"

        "content": "Donald Trump has never had much use for electric vehicles. The EV industry, meanwhile, has relied on government subsidies to get a jump-start in America. So what happens now that Trump is returning to the White House?\n\nWall Street observers have a \"widespread belief\" that Trump will target the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles , said Al Root at Barron's . That's the bad news for the EV industry. The better news is that those same analysts expect Trump to leave other parts of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act intact — the law has enabled a manufacturing surge that has benefited red states. But those are just guesses. \"Trump isn't a fan of EVs,\" said Root.\n\nIf Trump ends the EV tax credit, \"Elon Musk and Tesla would reap the rewards,\" said CNN . That might seem counterintuitive, as Tesla only makes electric vehicles, but Musk's company is currently the \"only automaker making a profit on its U.S. EV sales.\" Ending the credit might reduce Tesla's profits, but other automakers could see their losses increase. They might even leave the EV market, CNN said, which \"would mean less competition among EV buyers for Tesla.\" That means Musk's political alliance with Trump could affect the entire auto industry.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nElectric vehicles \"won't tank under Trump,\" Emily Dreibelbis Forlini said at PCMag . That's because EVs have a \"strong base of suburban drivers who love them\" for their ability to accelerate so quickly. The tax credit requires automakers to source their batteries domestically — erasing the credit could prompt American automakers to seek out cheaper Chinese batteries, which would \"lower the vehicle cost, and put more zero-emission vehicles on the road.\"\n\nEnding the EV tax credit would result in an \"earnings bloodbath\" for companies like Ford and GM, Liam Denning said at Bloomberg . They've already spent billions of dollars on the infrastructure to build electric vehicles. Now they just need to \"sell more EVs in order to reap economies of scale on existing investment.\" That's less likely to happen if the credit goes away, Denning said. Those companies now have to hope that \"Trump won't make good on everything he says.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nIt's not just the tax credit that will determine the future of EVs in the United States. Trump has also threatened ultra-high tariffs on auto imports from Mexico, which \"could be a problem for Tesla,\" said Business Insider . Musk's company last year announced a new factory near Monterrey, Mexico, a project that has been \"hit by delays and uncertainty\" amid the U.S. presidential campaign. But it could be a bigger problem for Tesla's competitors: One investment bank warned that the proposed tariffs would be \"highly disruptive\" to the U.S. automakers that already have plants in the country."

        "title": "Tesla Powerwall is the best solar, home backup, and EV charging companion",
        "description": "Come learn about the Tesla Powerwall and how it's pretty much necessary if you're installing a solar power system or own an EV vehicle from Tesla.",
        "link": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/brc/tesla-powerwall-best-solar-companion-bestbuy-2024/",
        "publish_date": "2024-11-20T18:00:17Z",
        "content": "Solar power, and having solar panels on your home, is a fantastic way to conserve energy and cut down on power bills, especially if you live somewhere sunny like Florida or California. There’s just one glaring issue. When the grid goes down you still lose power because of how it’s connected. Your solar panels cannot generate enough energy or keep it stored to keep your power on. So, essentially, your power setup doesn’t offer much benefit there, unless you get a home power backup system. More specifically, something like a Tesla Powerwall is a compact home battery that stores energy generated from the grid. That energy is then used as a backup when traditional grid power is unavailable.\n\nTo make it even more clear, with a Tesla Powerwall, the power stays on even during a major blackout or outage. It’s whole-home backup, too, which means you can power your lights, appliances, electronics, you name it. If you’ve ever had to throw away an entire refrigerator’s worth of spoiled food because of a multi-day outage — like I have — you’ll certainly appreciate the option to keep your appliances running. But that’s not all it can do. The Tesla Powerwall is an excellent companion for Tesla EV owners, creating an entire smart ecosystem of power. Let’s explore.\n\nGenerating whole-home backup power from solar\n\nTypically, if the power goes out you’d need to connect a generator to your home to get things back up and running. Gas generators are loud, they have to remain outside — because the fumes are dangerous — and they’re not exactly convenient. They often come in heavy, bulky form factors and it takes a bit of work to get them set up. That’s even more challenging during a huge storm or weather event. But Tesla Powerwall is none of those things. Instead, it’s a battery backup that connects to your local home power and your solar system.\n\nBasically, your solar panels generate energy, like normal, while excess power is stored in the Tesla Powerwall. Then, when the power goes out, the Powerwall takes over supplying the backup power you need. Powerwall automatically detects the outage and instantly powers your home with the stored backup energy. Even better, a feature called Storm Watch automatically ensures your Powerwall is fully charged before a major storm hits. That way you’re always prepared. Powerwall is also expandable, similar to portable power stations, meaning you can upgrade the capacity to handle, and power, more and more gear. It can be used with or without solar, as well.\n\nPlus, smart energy controls with the Tesla app\n\nEvery Powerwall features built-in energy monitoring, metering and smart controls. Moreover, it syncs with the Tesla app, so at any time you can control and configure your system, using your phone, or check energy usage and other stats. You can also customize your setup, like setting up the system to only charge when your local utility’s electricity costs are low to save even more money, or discharging automatically when costs are high to use less grid power. You can fine-tune the experience and use your power how you want. No more staying beholden to the local utility companies.\n\nPowerwall also qualifies for a 30% federal tax credit, as of 2023. That Residential Federal Investment Tax Credit gets you money back, regardless of power source, making it a solid investment all around. If you already have solar, then there’s really no reason not to opt for a Powerwall and home battery backup solution. That allows you to actually use the solar power you’re generating — your solar power — even when the grid is down.\n\nThe solar and Tesla ecosystem is where it’s at\n\nBeyond saving money and being able to use solar as a home backup, the Tesla Powerwall opens up another opportunity, especially for Tesla EV owners. Powerwall coordinates with Tesla vehicles, offering enhanced vehicle charging support during outages. But here’s the thing, it charges vehicles without exceeding the energy and power capabilities of the battery system.\n\nHere’s how it works: During an outage, Powerwall charges your Tesla based on the charging threshold. That threshold is what specifically determines how much energy is routed to the vehicle. In other words, Powerwall will never go below the set threshold (capacity). Once it drops below the threshold the vehicle charging stops, safely, and Powerwall continues to provide backup power to your home as normal. Even better, if your home is equipped with solar — and why wouldn’t it be — that energy can help charge the Powerwall, and by proxy, charge your Tesla EV.\n\nProvided you have the right connectors installed, you can leave everything connected to be managed automatically by the Tesla Powerwall system. You don’t have to go in your garage, hook everything up, unhook everything when it’s done, and keep fiddling with cables and ports. It’s all done and managed automatically, and you can always monitor what’s happening through the Tesla app. That not only brings you tons of convenience but peace of mind, more so during major events like storms, outages, and hurricanes.\n\nThe ultimate solar, home backup, and EV companion\n\nFrankly, if you have a solar system installed on your home and you don’t have a home battery backup connected, like a Tesla Powerwall, you’re not using it to its full potential. You’re definitely losing benefits on your investment. Powerwall can keep the power on during outages, and it can help you conserve energy and cut down on your power bill even more. Best of all, it’s an excellent Tesla EV companion, allowing you to charge your vehicle as needed, whether during an outage or through solar energy.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how rare outages are near you — if they’re frequent this definitely doesn’t apply — the first time you lose all of your food, can’t stay cool or warm, and have to go without power for days, you’ll truly appreciate the existence of technology such as this. I highly recommend equipping your home with a Tesla Powerwall before it gets to that point. You’ll always be prepared for whatever comes your way, and you can continue charging your EV without racking up your power bills."

        "content": "A recent crash that killed four people in a Tesla illustrates the importance of keeping mechanical handles on vehicles, writes Jesus Diaz in Fast Company.\n\n“As Tesla details on its website, the Model Y features electronic door latches that require pressing a button to open via an electric mechanism. The car also has a mechanical emergency open system that many say would be nearly impossible to operate in an actual emergency.” The people involved in the latest crash were trapped inside the car, unable to open the doors — and neither were passersby who tried to help.\n\nI get it, opening a door by clicking a button may seem cool—until it kills you. But the fact is that these buttons, just like the touch interfaces that control many car functions nowadays, are dangerous.\n\nAccording to Diaz, all Tesla models have complicated emergency release mechanisms that require removing a panel or reaching under a seat. “Most people traveling in these cars are clueless about these mechanisms,” Diaz adds.\n\nTo address the issue, the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) has announced that “starting in 2026, vehicles that delegate essential functions to touchscreens and fail to meet minimum physical control requirements will not qualify for the highest safety certifications.”"

        "content": "While she did not make a formal endorsement during the presidential campaign, Kim Kardashian is really leaning into a Republican vibe as of late. There’s her friendship with Ivanka Trump and her new campaign with Dolce & Gabbana — and now she’s chosen to align herself with Donald Trump’s new right-hand man, Elon Musk. Earlier this week, Kardashian showed off her new Tesla Optimus, a humanoid robot that Musk promises will be able to “be a teacher, babysit your kids, walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries, just be your friend.” Kardashian has now found a new thing to add to the list: photo-shoot partner.\n\nOn Tuesday, the reality star shared a carousel of images that I guess is supposed to make me think she’s dating the robot. It’s positioned behind the wheel of the new Tesla Cybercab, while Kardashian squats in front of it, holds its hand, and sits on its lap. If you think this is bizarro behavior, most of the people in the comments agree with you. “Sorry Kim, you’re not gonna normalise this weird behaviour for us we don’t want this,” reads the top comment. “This tells us exactly everything we need to know,” reads another. Desus Nice came out and said what everyone was thinking, writing, “Maga mommy we see you.”\n\nThe Skims founder has actually been close to Trump for longer than Musk has. (Do you think she made the intro?) She visited the White House a couple of times during Trump’s first term — who can forget this photo — and worked closely with Ivanka and Jared Kushner on her criminal-justice-reform campaigns.\n\nKardashian hopped on the Tesla bandwagon earlier this year, when she started driving a Cybertruck. Since then, the relationship has clearly blossomed, as she’s now promoting the Optimus and the Cybercab to her 359 million followers. She’s picked an interesting time to align herself with Musk, who has not left Donald Trump’s side since the election and was recently given his own department in the federal government. Maybe Kimmy will get one next.\n\nStay in touch. Get the Cut newsletter delivered daily Email This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

Had seen 1 other one on the 401\n\n\n\nPretty cool to see this beast @Tesla $TSLA #CyberTruck pic.twitter.com/DdJHCU8PwX — Hedge (@HedgehogPlus) November 16, 2024\n\nOne parking enforcement officer even shared how she issued a Cybertruck a ticket on Bloor Street, marking her very first encounter with one.\n\nResidents of other cities, like Vancouver, are starting to notice more of the vehicles around, too.\n\nThey’ve been out in Vancouver for 10 days I already see them everywhere. — turkish (@t_rkish) November 18, 2024\n\nAs many rave about the one-of-a-kind EV as the car of the future in both look and functionality, others are still hellbent against the latest brainchild of controversial billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nFlashy, expensive, gimmicky and perhaps unnecessary, it is certainly turning heads — while also turning the concept of the standard truck on its head."

        "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk mockingly asked, “Do you sell cars?” after Jaguar release rebrand video.",
        "link": "https://fortune.com/2024/11/20/jaguar-brand-campaign-evs-elon-musk/",
        "publish_date": "2024-11-20T13:57:58Z",
        "content": "If there is one charitable thing to say about Jaguar’s new brand campaign, it’s that people are, at the very least, finally talking about the ailing U.K. carmaker again. A new spot that aired on social media on Tuesday went viral with over 22 million views already on X—and not in a good way.\n\nThe 30-second ad features several ethnically diverse and largely gender-fluid models dressed in matching androgynous outfits set against loud colors, promising Jaguar will “break moulds,” “delete ordinary,” and “copy nothing.”\n\nWith not a car in sight, Jaguar Land Rover’s chief creative officer, Gerry McGovern, was forced to promise reporters his team had “not been sniffing the white stuff” when they came up with it.\n\nJaguar’s reboot, complete with its postmodern aesthetic and logo, comes ahead of an all-new EV-only lineup arriving in 2026.\n\nIt is potentially a last-ditch attempt to save the once venerable carmaker.\n\nAnnual sales for the fiscal year through March 2024 amounted to just 67,000 vehicles, well below the 115,000 units sibling brand Land Rover sold with its rugged Defender SUV model alone.\n\nIn the first half of fiscal 2025, Jaguar sales fell over 40% to roughly 14,000 cars, accounting for just 8% of Jaguar Land Rover volumes.\n\nPerhaps it’s no surprise that Jaguar managing director Rawdon Glover spoke about his marque in a statement as if it were already comatose, if not outright deceased.\n\nAcknowledging the reality of its dwindling relevance, Glover said he didn’t have the luxury of being timid.\n\n“To bring back such a globally renowned brand, we had to be fearless,” he said of the campaign on Tuesday, calling it a “complete reset.”\n\nThe unveiling of its Design Vision Concept on Dec. 2 during Miami Art Week will give a first taste of what is to come for “New Jaguar.”\n\nMusk mocks brand campaign online\n\nThe problem is that to be effective, brand campaigns need to deliver on their promise with actual products that live up to the claims made.\n\nAnd for the moment, Jaguar has little to show for itself.\n\nLast week it stopped selling new cars in its home U.K. market, and other markets will eventually follow as it eliminates the last vestiges of its combustion engine past.\n\nEverything is, therefore, riding on its upcoming event early next month.\n\nCourtesy of Jaguar Land Rover\n\nBut its recent history hasn’t exactly suggested Jaguar will “break moulds.”\n\nThe ad has, therefore, been widely met with resounding ridicule online.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk mockingly asked, “Do you sell cars?” while others derided what appears to be a message of diversity, equity, and inclusion—now firmly out of fashion in the United States.\n\nOne user on X summed up the spot as “when you walk into the elevator and the entire DEI department is there.”\n\nExecs are now left wondering whether all this free publicity will help or hurt its brand reset.\n\nFortune has contacted Jaguar for a statement about the spot’s reception but has not yet received a response.\n\nJaguar’s long descent into irrelevance\n\nBest known for its classic 1960s E-Type coupe, which oozed style with its characteristic elongated bonnet, Jaguar never really recovered from its disastrous period under Ford.\n\nUnder the U.S. carmaker’s ownership, the brand was hollowed out from within through mass-market cars like the X-Type.\n\nThe sedan became one of the worst examples of badge engineering: Underneath, it was a bastardized version of the Ford Mondeo with a bit of Jaguar styling and logo slapped on top, a monstrosity that diluted its brand equity and horrified the loyal fan base.\n\nUnder its current owner, Tata Motors, which bought Jaguar and Land Rover 16 years ago in a packaged deal, the U.K. carmaker attempted a revival.\n\nJaguar launched for the first time in its history SUVs like the F-Pace and briefly grabbed industry accolades with its I-Pace electric crossover, but the damage had already been done.\n\nRebirth nearly four years in the planning\n\nNow execs are clearing out the entire range as part of a reboot first mapped out under a vastly different landscape.\n\nBack in February 2021, during the height of the EV bubble, the then head of Tata’s Jaguar Land Rover division, Thierry Bolloré, unveiled his “Reimagine” plan, which would see Jaguar move to an EV-only lineup four years later.\n\nAt the time, that seemed like the obvious move, as EVs appeared to be well positioned to replace combustion-engine cars.\n\nClean, quiet propulsion technology has been viewed as superior in performance to gas cars, with smooth, swift acceleration from a standstill minus the clouds of pollutant-laden smoke belching from tailpipes.\n\nThis proved overly optimistic, though, with EV adoption slowing to a crawl in Western markets.\n\nNow, even pioneer Tesla doesn’t bother selling investors on the technology, having pivoted its messaging to what Musk calls “real-world AI”: autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nBut JLR still needs EVs for CO2 regulatory compliance in order to continue selling heavy, thirsty, yet comparatively profitable, Land Rover SUVs across Europe.\n\nAnd there’s reason to believe it may have some success with that approach.\n\nNext year sees a phase-in of new fleet emission targets for carmakers in the European Union that will require an even larger proportion of EVs in a manufacturer’s sales mix.\n\nBy the time Jaguar’s first EVs arrive, the technology may have finally gone mainstream in Europe.\n\nHowever, whether buyers may want the kind of car it plans to unveil next month is another issue entirely. For the moment, though, its boss remains optimistic.\n\n“I am excited for the world to finally see Jaguar,” Glover said."

Conducted by iSeeCars, the study analyzed data from the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which covers crashes from 2017 to 2022. This comes amid rising discussions about Tesla's self-driving mode and recent challenges faced by California police with Tesla patrol cars.According to the study, Tesla cars have a fatal crash rate of 5.6 per billion miles driven. This is higher than other brands like Kia, which has a fatal crash rate of 5.5, and Buick at 4.8. The national average fatal crash rate for all cars in the U.S. stands at 2.8 per billion miles. However, the study highlights that Tesla’s high crash rate does not indicate that their vehicles are inherently unsafe.The study also pointed out that Tesla vehicles come equipped with advanced safety technology. In fact, the 2024 Tesla Model Y was awarded the Top Safety Pick+ award by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Tesla cars are known for their innovative safety features, including automatic emergency braking and collision avoidance systems, designed to prevent accidents.Karl Brauer, an executive analyst at iSeeCars, explained that the higher fatal crash rate in Tesla vehicles may reflect a combination of factors, such as driving behavior and road conditions. He emphasized that a responsible, alert driver who follows traffic laws is most likely to avoid accidents, regardless of the car model they drive.While the data indicates a higher fatal crash rate for Tesla vehicles, it doesn’t imply that Tesla cars are unsafe. Many factors, including driver habits and external conditions, play a role in the overall crash statistics.The study by iSeeCars found that Tesla vehicles have the highest fatal crash rate among all car brands in the U.S., with a fatal crash rate of 5.6 per billion miles driven.Tesla's fatal crash rate of 5.6 per billion miles is higher than Kia (5.5) and Buick (4.8). The national average fatal crash rate for all cars in the U.S. is 2.8 per billion miles."

A spokesperson for Ford denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.\n\nFact Check:\n\nMusk has reportedly clashed with Boris Epshteyn over President-Elect Donald Trump’s cabinet picks, according to Axios. Musk has accused Epshteyn, a top Trump adviser, of leaking the President-Elect’s personnel picks to the media, the outlet indicated.\n\nThe Facebook post claims Musk has purportedly acquired Ford Motor Company.\n\n“In an unexpected move, Elon Musk has announced the acquisition of the iconic Ford automotive brand, marking a milestone in the automotive industry. The acquisition, which surprised investors and industry followers alike, is portrayed as a revolutionary step in the electric and autonomous vehicle market,” the post reads in part.\n\n“With this purchase, Musk plans to combine Ford’s historic manufacturing experience with Tesla’s cutting-edge technology, driving the transition toward a future of sustainable mobility. Analysts speculate that this alliance will allow Ford to incorporate innovations in electrical technology and artificial intelligence, which could accelerate new model development and redefine the global automotive market,” it continues.\n\nThe claim is false. Musk does not appear to have publicly commented on the claim via his verified X account. Likewise, Ford Motor Company has not issued a press release or social media statement confirming the purported acquisition.\n\nIn addition, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim. Actually, the opposite is true. On Nov. 14, PolitiFact debunked the claim. According to the outlet, the claim seems to originate from a Sept. 16 YouTube video shared by the channel “Elon Musk Rewind.” The video’s description indicates the content is “unverified,” and its information should not be “considered the truth.”\n\nBesides PolitiFact, Snopes, VERIFY, and Rappler also debunked the claim.

At the time of writing, autonomous car companies need to get state-by-state approval for all their models (some states like Texas and Florida have no such restriction).\n\nTherefore, introducing a simpler approval framework will help with faster and smoother adoption of self-driving technology.\n\nAs per reports, Trump’s transition team is already in talks with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to get started on the task.\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that the aforementioned report hasn’t yet been independently verified, seeing as both the transition team and the NHTSA haven’t responded to any requests for a comment.\n\nMusk Continues to Benefit from Trump’s Victory\n\nIf this framework is actually applied, no one will benefit more than Elon Musk. He has been promising fully autonomous self-driving cars for years now but has yet to achieve this goal.\n\nAlthough there were many technical barriers in the way, legal hurdles and regulatory frameworks were also slowing him down. However, all of this is set to change.\n\nThere’s no second-guessing that the victory of Trump was also a victory for Musk, who played a pivotal role in this year’s election.\n\nWith millions of dollars in campaign funding, holding rallies for the presidential candidate, and openly endorsing him on social media, Musk has done a lot to get Trump back in the White House. And it looks like the President is now returning the favor to his most loyal supporter.\n\nIn fact, just a few days ago, Trump also announced that Musk will be co-leading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency along with Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThis department will be responsible for suggesting budgetary cuts and fund reallocation to the government. Many have spoken against this decision, citing Musk’s lack of administrative experience as one of the biggest reasons. However, Trump has dismissed these concerns by reiterating that Musk’s role is purely advisory.\n\nAdd Techreport to Your Google News Feed Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.
