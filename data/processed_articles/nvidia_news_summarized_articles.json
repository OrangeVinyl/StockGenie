        "content": "Samsung's ambition to secure NVIDIA as an HBM customer is not over yet, as a new report suggests that Team Green is still working on a breakthrough.\n\nNVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang Says That Team Green Is Working \"As Fast As It Can\" To Initiate Samsung's HBM Supply For AI Chips\n\nFor those unaware, well, the Korean giant isn't having a great time regarding its HBM business and adoption of the mainstream AI markets, given that a few weeks ago, we reported on how Samsung disclosed that they haven't managed to secure NVIDIA as a customer. This not only resulted in a financial hit for the company, but many anticipated that it was over for Samsung and that its plans were to be included in NVIDIA's supply chain.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg reports that NVIDIA's CEO has disclosed that they are working with Samsung to certify their \"AI memory\" chips, claiming that they are working \"as fast as possible\" to initiate the HBM business with the Korean giant. Jensen made this statement during an interview at an event at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Team Green is said to be looking at securing 8-Hi and 12-Hi HBM3E from Samsung, and given the massive demand the company faces, NVIDIA must conclude soon.\n\nFor Samsung, well securing orders from the green team is a crucial development for them in the AI markets, given that this partnership would put the Korean giant on level with competitors such as SK hynix, which will ultimately change the investors' stance towards a more bullish one for Samsung. Apart from this, getting involved in NVIDIA's supply chain will open up prospects for Samsung, and since the Korean giant has a semiconductor supply as well, NVIDIA can potentially benefit from it, too.\n\nIt would be interesting to see whether Samsung manages to earn NVIDIA's trust moving into the future. Given that the qualification process has now extended to such a long period of time, Team Green would surely manage to include the Korean giant in its supply chain.",
        "summary": "Samsung is still pursuing NVIDIA as a customer for its High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips, despite previous setbacks. NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, has stated that the company is working quickly to certify Samsung's AI memory chips, aiming to integrate them into their supply chain. This partnership is crucial for Samsung to compete with rivals like SK hynix in the AI market and could positively influence investor sentiment. Securing NVIDIA as a customer would also open new opportunities for Samsung, leveraging its semiconductor supply capabilities. The ongoing qualification process suggests that Samsung may eventually succeed in becoming part of NVIDIA's supply chain.",

        "description": "If Nvidia significantly exceeds conservative growth targets with help from Blackwell, the stock could rise despite slowing revenue growth, and the absence of a killer app for generative AI",
        "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/11/24/nvidia-stock-may-rise-as-musk-aims-to-buy-9-billion-in-ai-chips/",
        "publish_date": "2024-11-24T17:51:41Z",
        "content": "Will Nvidia’s growth rate keep slowing down? If so, investors may be wise to take their profits. However, if the AI chip designer’s new products spur faster growth, now might be a buying opportunity.\nStock prices rise when companies exceed investor expectations and raise guidance and they drop if companies fall short on either one. Nvidia is no exception to this rule.\nTo justify buying Nvidia stock now that it’s the most valuable company in the world — having enjoyed a 195% rise in its share price to a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion this year — you must believe the company will keep beating and raising.\nIf Nvidia significantly exceeds conservative growth targets with help from Blackwell, the stock could rise despite slowing revenue growth, dependence on a few large customers, and the absence of a killer app to deliver a return on the rising investment needed to train and operate AI chatbots.\nReasons Nvidia Stock Could Drop\nNvidia stock presents investors with significant risks. These include the following:\n- Revenue growth slowing down. Nvidia’s revenues grew in a range of 206% to 265% during Q4 2023, Q1 2024, and Q2 2024. Nvidia’s 94% revenue growth in the third quarter was still very rapid — but considerably slower than in previous quarters. Nvidia’s forecast of 70% growth in Q4 is a continuation of this deceleration trend, according to my November Forbes post.\n- Dependence on small number of large customers. Nvidia has three key accounts — each of which contribute more than 10% of the company’s total revenue, according to Social Press Blog. In the first nine months of 2024, these unnamed key accounts individually bought between $10 billion and $11 billion worth of goods and services from Nvidia, according to its latest quarterly filing with the SEC. These customers could be Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and SuperMicro, according to Bloomberg Intelligence global head of technology research Mandeep Singh. If Singh is correct, SuperMicro’s delayed financial statements could pose a risk to Nvidia investors.\n- Growing investment required to sustain generative AI. Investments to build generative AI — including data centers, chips, software, electricity, and water could top $1 trillion by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. To power their processing chips and cool the heat they emit, AI computer centers will continue to consume enormous amounts of electricity and water — rising from a range of 3% to 4% of the nation’s total in 2024 to “between 11% and 12% in 2030,” reported the Wall Street Journal. Unless that investment yields faster revenue growth or much lower costs, companies could ultimately cut back — which could crimp Nvidia’s growth.\n- Absence of a generative AI killer app that could yield high return on investment. A killer app for generative AI that yields a high ROI remains elusive. Most people using generative AI are doing it to help them overcome, say, writer’s block as they compose an email, according to the Boston Globe. A small number of companies are using AI to boost the productivity of business processes such as sales, customer service, and coding. While companies are seeking generative AI applications that produce faster growth, they are more concept than reality. If such a killer app does not emerge, companies will cut back on investing in generative AI — which could hurt Nvidia’s growth.\nReasons Nvidia Stock Could Keep Going Up\nMy guess is investors are baking all these negatives into their expectations. Indeed, despite Nvidia’s slowing growth in 2024, the company’s stock has continued to rise. This could be because the company has been doing a good job of lowering investors’ growth expectations.\nPositive surprises to growth would keep Nvidia stock rising. Huge orders for the company’s latest chip line by the largest AI service providers — coupled with growing corporate interest in applying AI to make processes more efficient — could provide investors with unexpected good news. Here’s how:\n- Big Blackwell orders ahead. Blackwell chips are expected to generate $13 billion in Q4 2024 revenue for Nvidia. These chips are more energy efficient and faster then the company’s previous high-end chips — “about 25 times as energy efficient,” noted the Journal with 30 times faster processing speed, Forbes reported.\n- Rise of Nvidia super clusters. The largest AI service providers are building multi-billion dollar super clusters of computer servers that “contain unprecedented numbers of Nvidia’s most advanced chips,” according to the Wall Street Journal. For example, in 2024 Elon Musk’s xAI built Colossus — a supercomputer in Memphis — with 100,000 Nvidia Hopper AI chips. By next summer, xAI could host a super cluster with 300,000 Blackwell chips, according to the Journal. At $30,000 per chip, Musk’s $9 billion worth of Blackwell chips could offer upside surprise for Nvidia investors.\n- Increased CEO talk about generative AI applications in Q3 2024. In Q3 2024, CEOs discussed using AI and automation to streamline processes at a higher rate than quarters before, according to IOT Analytics. Some of the key AI-related use cases included process automation (up 59% since Q2), digital twin (up 35%); and conversational AI (+28.6%). While it remains to be seen whether this talk will translate into faster growth, it could lead to a killer app for AI which would benefit Nvidia.\nUntil Nvidia can unlock faster-than-expected growth, its stock could be stuck in a trading range.",
        "summary": "Nvidia's stock performance is closely tied to its ability to exceed investor expectations and raise guidance, with its recent growth slowing down, posing potential risks for investors. The company faces challenges such as dependence on a few large customers, significant investment requirements for generative AI, and the absence of a high-return generative AI application. Despite these risks, Nvidia's stock has continued to rise, possibly due to the company's effective management of investor expectations. Positive factors that could drive Nvidia's stock up include large orders for its new Blackwell chips, the development of super clusters by major AI service providers, and increased corporate interest in AI applications. However, without faster-than-expected growth, Nvidia's stock may remain in a trading range.",

Current AI servers use 130-250 kW, but future models like Blackwell Ultra and Rubin AI servers will require 250-900 kW, with up to 576 GPUs per rack by 2026-2027. AI servers are projected to consume over 1000 kW of power due to NVIDIA's upcoming Rubin Ultra AI GPU and HBM4 memory. Current AI servers use 130-250 kW, but future models like Blackwell Ultra and Rubin AI servers will require 250-900 kW, with up to 576 GPUs per rack by 2026-2027.\n\nAI servers of the future are expected to use over 1000 kW of power, with the rise of NVIDIA's next-gen Rubin Ultra AI GPU and its new HBM4 memory coming that will see a rise in power consumption of AI servers.\n\nThe current best AI servers and clusters with a rack density of 130 kW to 250 kW of power according to an analyst by data center firm Vertiv. But these numbers are going to skyrocket with Blackwell Ultra and Rubin AI servers using between 250 kW and 900 kW of power with up to 576 GPUs in a single rack expected in 2026-2027.\n\nAfter that, NVIDIA will have its future-gen, beefed-up Rubin Ultra AI GPUs inside of new AI servers in 2028-2029+ that will use 1000 kW or more. Vertiv notes that \"densification roadmaps point to extreme peak rack densities of 1mW+ resulting in estimated new build average rack density increasing across varying workloads applications and market segments\".\n\nRewinding the clock back to just 4 years ago, in 2020 the average rack density was rated at around 8.2 kW, but with the insatiable demand of AI, that power consumption has skyrocketed to the likes of 132 kW with NVIDIA's new GB200 NVL72 AI cabinet, which is the highest power-consuming server in history.\n\nNVIDIA's next-gen Rubin and Rubin Ultra AI GPUs are going to be quite exciting, with the new Rubin AI GPU architecture and future-gen HBM4 memory, which you can read more about here.",

        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said he doesn't think the industry can solve the AI hallucination issue, wherein an AI makes up information to fill in its knowledge gaps, for several more years. Huang also outlined how he had wooed his wife by promising he would be a CEO by the age of 30. Huang discussed these and other topics, like how much computing needs increased in the past 10 years, during an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nThe host said the demand for AI computing power jumps four times annually. “In 10 years, it’s [an] enormous number, actually a million.” He also added that’s why Nvidia’s stock went up 300x. “The computing needs are a million times more, so then it explains the stock probably is not that expensive.” He then asked Huang, “As you look into the future with your crystal ball, are we going to see that a million times more needs increase for the next 10 years?”\n\nHuang did not give a direct answer, but he first explained how artificial intelligence is being developed today. The first area is pre-training, which the Nvidia CEO compared to going to college. Here, the AI takes in all the data in the world and discovers knowledge through it. Huang says this is a “very important milestone, but it’s not enough.” The second area in the AI development process is post-training, where it dives deep into a particular skill via “reinforcement learning [through] human feedback, reinforcement learning [through] AI feedback, synthetic data generation, multipath learning, reinforcement learning [sic]—there’s a whole bunch of techniques.”\n\nFinally, the third area of AI development is Test Time Scaling, which he also referred to as “thinking.” This is much more complicated, as the AI now breaks the problem down step by step to find a solution. It might have to iterate and sometimes simulate various outcomes, especially if the answer is not predictive. He says, “We call that thinking, and the longer you think, maybe the higher quality the answer would become.”\n\nNVIDIA's Jensen Huang On How He Wooed His Wife Saying He'll Be CEO By 30, Leaves Students In Splits - YouTube Watch On\n\nBut despite all these areas of development, Huang says that we still can’t fully trust the best answers that AI can deliver. “Today, the answers that we have are the best that we can, but we need to get to a point where the answer that you get is not the best that we can provide, and somewhat you still have to decide whether is this hallucinated or not hallucinated, does this make sense, is it sensible or not sensible? We have to get to a point where the answer that you get, you largely trust.” He also added, “I think that we’re several years away from being able to do that, and in the meantime, we have to keep increasing our computation.”\n\nDespite this, he also pointed out what Nvidia has done for AI, “What Nvidia has contributed is that we’ve taken the marginal cost of computing and reduced it by a million times.” He said, “When the cost of something reduces by a million times, your habits fundamentally change…that is the single greatest contribution Nvidia ever made, that we made it so that using a machine to learn exhaustively an enormous amount of data is something that researchers wouldn’t even think twice to do. That’s why machine learning has taken off.”\n\nWhen someone pointed out that Nvidia’s AI GPUs are still expensive, Huang said that it’d be a million times more expensive if Nvidia didn’t exist. “I gave you a million times discount in the last 10 years. It’s practically free!” said Jensen.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

He was the youngest kid in his class, and there were only three women among the students. Huang said, “You have to learn how to have a good pickup line.” So, Jensen approached her and asked, “Do you want to see my homework?” She eventually agreed since he promised that if she did homework with him every Sunday, she’d get straight As—resulting in a weekly Sunday date for Huang.\n\n“Just to make sure that eventually she marries me, I told her that by the time I’m 30, I just wanted you [to] know I’m only 20 right now. But by the time I’m 30, I’m going to be a CEO—I have no idea what I was talking about—and then we got married.” Jensen said. “That’s all the advice I’m going to give all the entrepreneurs. That’s it.”",

During an interview, Huang also shared a personal anecdote about wooing his wife by promising to become a CEO by age 30, which he used as a humorous pickup line. He explained the three stages of AI development: pre-training, post-training, and Test Time Scaling, emphasizing the complexity and need for further advancements. Huang highlighted Nvidia's significant contribution to AI by drastically reducing computing costs, which has facilitated the growth of machine learning.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street.\n\nData centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues",

        "content": "Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception.\n\nIn 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\n\n• USD (NVDA) View Quote Details\n\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\n\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\n\nThere’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\n\nIs Wall Street wary? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco, (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be.\n\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\n\n“We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies’ director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\n\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware.\n\nBeware political uncertainty: President-elect Donald Trump arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight with Elon Musk from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on Nov. 19. (Photo: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nNvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne.\n\nStory Continues",
        "summary": "In recent years, investment trends have shifted from work-from-home setups in 2020 to artificial intelligence in 2024, with Nvidia emerging as a leading player in the AI sector. Nvidia's prominence is underscored by its significant partnerships with major companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, which are rapidly acquiring its AI-focused chips. Despite surpassing quarterly expectations and providing strong guidance, Nvidia's stock experienced a temporary dip as investors took profits or were disappointed by the slower growth rate compared to previous quarters. Proponents of AI and Nvidia believe the company is well-positioned to lead the next wave of computing transformation, while some analysts express skepticism about the return on investment for Nvidia's customers. Additionally, concerns about Nvidia's ability to meet the high demand for its Blackwell chip contribute to the cautious outlook among some market observers.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nPhillip Securities downgrades Nvidia stock\n\nPhillip Securities cut its rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) on Friday from Buy to Accumulate, citing recent price movements in the chipmaker’s stock. The firm raised its price target for Nvidia slightly, increasing it to $160 from $155.\n\n“We downgrade [from] BUY to ACCUMULATE due to recent price movements, with a higher target price of US$160,” noted analyst Yik Ban Chong.\n\nPhillip Securities highlights that Nvidia's fiscal Q3 2025 results were in line with the firm's expectations, with revenue exceeding Nvidia’s guidance by 8%. Profit after tax and minority interests (PATMI) grew an impressive 109% year-over-year.\n\nIn its note, the investment firm emphasized that roughly half of Nvidia’s data center sales come from hyperscalers, with the remainder driven by enterprises and sovereign clients. Production of the company’s Blackwell chips is expected to begin in Q4 2025, with projected revenues exceeding initial forecasts of \"several billion dollars.\"\n\nNvidia anticipates that the initial rollout of Blackwell will yield gross margins in the low-70% range, eventually improving to mid-70% as production scales up.\n\nWhile the rating downgrade reflects short-term price movement, Phillip Securities has maintained its fiscal year 2025 revenue and PATMI estimates. The firm has also raised its forecasts for fiscal year 2026 revenue and PATMI by 5% and 7%, respectively.\n\nThese adjustments account for a stronger-than-expected ramp-up of Nvidia’s data accelerator platforms, including Hopper and Blackwell, alongside reduced corporate tax rates.\n\nThe firm also adjusted fiscal year 2026 margin assumptions, aligning with Nvidia’s guidance for lower margins due to the Blackwell product launch, while keeping its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and growth rate assumptions unchanged.\n\nBernstein sees Apple hitting $290 in bull-case scenario\n\nBernstein analysts suggest that Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares could reach $290 in their bull case scenario.\n\nThe firm regards Apple as “a quality compounder, with mid-single digit revenue growth, improving margins, disciplined capital return, and double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth.”\n\n“Given its negative cash conversion cycle, the stock is less expensive than it appears. Investors have fared well by maintaining AAPL as a core holding, and adding to positions on pullbacks,” added analysts led by Toni Sacconaghi.\n\nApple’s market position is highlighted by its ecosystem of over 2.3 billion devices and nearly one billion “unique, demographically attractive users.” Bernstein also identifies Apple as a key beneficiary of AI advancements in two significant ways.\n\nFirst, the firm anticipates an accelerated replacement cycle for Apple products, potentially beginning in fiscal year 2026. Second, they see AI integration driving new revenue streams for Apple, particularly through the distribution of large language models (LLMs) and third-party applications.\n\n“Encouragingly, given its position as a channel/platform, Apple’s capex has remained low. A key question is whether AI could structurally alter iPhone’s replacement cycle,” the analysts noted.\n\nThey also observed Apple’s distinct seasonal trading patterns, cautioning that while the iPhone 16 cycle might underperform, any drop in the stock price to $200 or below—particularly between February and April—would represent a buying opportunity.\n\nBernstein’s bull case envisions Apple achieving $9 in EPS by fiscal year 2026, which would value the stock at $290.\n\nNvidia earnings good for TSMC, BofA says\n\nNvidia’s strong third-quarter performance and outlook are bolstering the positive sentiment for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), according to Bank of America analysts.\n\n“The results underscore robust structural AI demand, with limited digestion periods as adoption accelerates,” said analysts led by Brad Lin.\n\nThey highlighted Nvidia's steady one-year cadence for data center GPU advancements, which has proven advantageous for TSMC by driving average selling price (ASP) content growth.\n\n“The continuous scaling of Al models strengthens TSMC's leading-edge node demand and industry leadership. Additionally, we are pleased to learn NVIDIA’s robust GPM outlook into CY2025, which reflects the stronger value TSMC offers to clients, vs ASP hikes,” the analysts added.\n\nAI demand continues to outpace supply, with Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs facing ongoing constraints. Bank of America notes that demand for Blackwell is expected to remain above supply into fiscal 2026, spurred by significant investments in AI—an encouraging signal for TSMC’s prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC continues making efforts to address its Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) bottlenecks by ramping up production. The company plans to expand its CoWoS capacity from 35-40,000 units per month in Q4 2024 to over 80,000 units by the end of 2025.\n\n“As AI models grow in complexity and require greater computing power, we believe TSMC is well-positioned to meet these demands,” Lin and his team concluded.\n\nSMCI too important for AI to be delisted: Lynx\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ: ) soared sharply this week after the AI server maker unexpectedly introduced an independent audit firm and submitted a compliance plan to NASDAQ. The move aims to prevent the company’s delisting, though formal approval from NASDAQ and an extension for its 10-K filing are still pending.\n\nAn analyst at Lynx Equity Strategies, however, views NASDAQ’s approval as likely a \"formality.\"\n\nIn a recent note, Lynx analyst KC Rajkumar highlighted SMCI's importance in the AI data center market, stating it is \"just too important a player in the AI data center space for it to be allowed to delist and go fallow.\" He emphasized that delisting, which would cut off access to capital, was a low-probability event, despite regulatory uncertainties.\n\nThe analyst also pointed out the stock’s substantial discount, setting a price target (PT) of $45. After SMCI’s 8-K filing, which significantly lowers the delisting risk, Rajkumar now predicts a \"vicious short-squeeze\" could follow, with shares potentially reaching his price target soon.\n\n“SMCI has a leadership position in the rapidly expanding liquid-cooled GPU server data center market, a position it is unlikely to give up any time soon,” Rajkumar said.\n\nRaymond James upgrades HPE to Strong Buy\n\nEarlier in the week, Raymond James upgraded Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE: ) to Strong Buy, citing optimism about the company’s refined business model. The shift, which now distinctly separates AI platforms from traditional servers, led the investment bank to raise its sales estimates for fiscal year 2025.\n\nHPE is expected to deliver in-line financial results when it reports on December 6, though the federal sector could pose risks. Despite this, Raymond (NS: ) James forecasts growth to accelerate in the fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe firm’s analysts also expect the Juniper Networks (NYSE: ) acquisition to close as planned, a move that could enhance HPE's stock valuation multiple.\n\nRaymond James projects robust growth in HPE’s AI server sales, increasing from $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $5.9 billion in FY25 and reaching $7.4 billion by FY26.\n\n“AI sales are mostly coming from AI model training applications, and HPE cited traction with sovereign networks,” noted analysts led by Simon Leopold.\n\nThey highlighted that enterprise clients, currently in the experimental phase, accounted for a mid-teens percentage of the backlog.\n\n“As enterprise adoption expands, we expect continued strong AI sales with improving margin. We include HPE within the context of an AI networking basket,” the analysts added.",

These GPUs will feature the new Blackwell architecture and next-generation GDDR7 memory. The release schedule aligns with previous rumors, with the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 expected in January, followed by the RTX 5070 in February. NVIDIA is set to launch four GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs, including the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, in Q1 2025. These GPUs will feature the new Blackwell architecture and next-generation GDDR7 memory. The release schedule aligns with previous rumors, with the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 expected in January, followed by the RTX 5070 in February.\n\nNVIDIA will reportedly launch 4 different GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs in Q1 2025, with new information teasing we'll see the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 all released in early 2025.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nThe new information is coming from Benchlife, which reports that its sources from the AIC and \"various passive component agents\" that NVIDIA will \"launch a complete GeForce RTX 50 series graphics card in the first half of 2025\". The list included a rundown of the launches, with the 4 higher SKUs launching in Q1 2025, and the others are \"TBC\" right now.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series \"Blackwell\" GPU release rumors:\n\nGeForce RTX 5090 : Q1 2025\n\nGeForce RTX 5080 : Q1 2025\n\nGeForce RTX 5070 Ti : Q1 2025\n\nGeForce RTX 5070 : Q1 2025\n\nGeForce RTX 5060 Ti : TBC\n\nGeForce RTX 5060: TBC\n\nThis lines up with previous rumors from October 2024, where we reported that NVIDIA would be launching the ultra-enthusiast flagship GeForce RTX 5090 in January alongside the GeForce RTX 5080. After that, rumor has it we'd see the RTX 5070 appear in February and the RTX 5060 in March.\n\nBenchlife's leaks tease the RTX 5070 Ti + RTX 5070 instead of the RTX 5070 + RTX 5060, so it still remains to be seen what we'll see in Q1 2025. NVIDIA will definitely launch the GeForce RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 in early 2025... but whether we see the RTX 5070 Ti + RTX 5070 or the RTX 5070 + RTX 5060 will be the big deal for gamers (as they won't be as expensive as the RTX 5090 or RTX 5080).\n\nIt looks like NVIDIA is going to be covering all of its bases with the RTX 50 series GPUs, rocking the new Blackwell GPU architecture, next-generation GDDR7 memory, a new process node, and so many more exciting things I'm sure that we don't know about yet.",

        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk might be the richest person in history, but he was way behind Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on the 2024 list of top earners. Mr Huang's annual earnings skyrocketed from $21.1 billion in 2023 to $77 billion in 2024, according to Forbes. This was nearly four-fold of Mr Musk's $15 billion increase in annual earnings from $180 billion in 2023 to $195 billion in 2024.\n\nThe massive boost took Mr Huang's net worth to $123.8 billion, placing him ninth on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaire List.\n\nTesla's soaring shares pushed Mr Musk's net worth to $334.3 billion this year.\n\nWho is Jensen Huang\n\nBorn in Taiwan and raised in the US from the age of nine, Mr Huang's academic journey led him from Oregon State University to Stanford University, where he specialised in electrical engineering. As co-founder and CEO of Nvidia since 1993, Mr Huang has been the visionary behind the company's rise as a leader in AI technology.\n\nNvidia's shares hit a record high this year, contributing significantly to Huang's fortune. His 3.5 per cent equity stake in the $3.5 trillion company now accounts for nearly all of his wealth, valued at $122.2 billion. Even after selling $713 million worth of Nvidia stock earlier this year, Mr Huang remains the company's largest shareholder.\n\nNvidia holds an 80 per cent market share in AI accelerators, crucial for cutting-edge AI applications used by tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and even Tesla. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs), initially popular in gaming, have become essential for AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Demand for Nvidia's products is so intense that Mr Huang described it as “insane,” with customers reportedly becoming “really emotional” over availability, Forbes reported.",
        "summary": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, despite being the richest person in history, was surpassed by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in terms of earnings growth in 2024. Jensen Huang's annual earnings surged from $21.1 billion in 2023 to $77 billion in 2024, significantly outpacing Musk's $15 billion increase. This increase boosted Huang's net worth to $123.8 billion, placing him ninth on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaire List. Nvidia's record-high shares and its 80% market share in AI accelerators have been pivotal in Huang's financial success, with his 3.5% stake in the company accounting for nearly all of his wealth. Nvidia's GPUs, essential for AI applications, have seen soaring demand, contributing to the company's and Huang's financial growth.",

The leaked data suggests the card is called PG147 and SKU 60 internally at NVIDIA, meaning it uses the same board as the RTX 5080 (which is SKU 45) which means we'll see a cut-down GB203 that's used on the RTX 5080.\n\nLeaker \"kopite7kimi\" has said that the RTX 5070 Ti should feature a 300W TDP, which is a 50W increase over the RTX 5070 and 100W less than the RTX 5080... so right in the middle. We don't know if we're looking at 300W of TGP (maximum) or TDP (thermal design power).\n\nWe've already heard and reported leaks on the GeForce RTX 5070 which is expected to debut with 12GB of GDDR7 memory, with leaks teasing 5% more performance in rasterization, and then 5-10% improvements in RT (ray tracing) over the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER.\n\nNVIDIA is also rumored to be working on the GeForce RTX 5070 with 18GB of GDDR7 memory... we can expect to hear more about that in the New Year. For now, we're hearing lots about the mid-range Blackwell gaming GPUs which is exciting, these bad boys will be competing against AMD's last RDNA (4) GPUs before the company shifts into its UDNA architecture moving forward.",

The latest info relates to the launch of these GPUs and while we expect NVIDIA to come up with at least RTX 5090 and 5080 in the initial batch, there are two more GPUs it may bring forward in the same time frame.\n\nGeForce RTX 5090 – Q1; GeForce RTX 5090\n\nD – Q1; GeForce RTX 5080 – Q1; GeForce RTX 5070 Ti – Q1; GeForce RTX 5070 – Q1; GeForce RTX 5060 Ti – TBC; GeForce RTX 5060 – TBC; via Benchlife\n\nAs reported by Benchlife, NVIDIA may launch both GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and 5070 GPUs just after the enthusiast-grade RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. The launch date is falling in the first quarter of 2025, which signals that CES might be the perfect time for the company to showcase its flagship products (RTX 5090 and 5080) for desktop gamers.\n\nHowever, both NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 may be revealed a month later, i.e., in February 2025. Up until now, it was rumored that the RTX 5070 would be the only 70-class card to get a release in Q1 2025, but it seems like the 5070 Ti will join it as well. In a nutshell, NVIDIA will take all four cards in the same quarter.\n\nLater on, the company is expected to reveal the 60-class card, possibly both RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060, only four months later. This means a May 2025 launch, but not many sources have confirmed this report. Nonetheless, the initial launch might reveal most things, including the release of slower cards and their specifications.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is going to be the third-fastest GPU in the series, featuring 8960 Cuda Cores, 16 GB GDDR7 memory, and a TGP of 300W. Benchlife says that even though some reports have confirmed the TGP to be 300W, one of NVIDIA's AIB partners has confirmed the TGP to be 350W. The RTX 5070 will have a 250W TGP, 6400 Cuda Cores, and a 12 GB GDDR7 VRAM.\n\nAs far as the RTX 5060 Ti and 5060 are considered, nothing substantial has been leaked. We will keep you updated as soon as we find more reliable reports about the specs and launch of these GPUs as well.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 & RTX 5080 GPU Specs (Rumor):\n\nGraphics Card Name NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU Name Blackwell GB202-300 Blackwell GB203-400 Ada Lovelace AD102-300 Ada Lovelace AD103-300 GPU SMs 170 (192 Full) 84 (84 Full) 128 (144 Full) 76 *80 Full) GPU Cores 21760 (+33%) 10752 (+11%) 16384 9728 Clock Speeds TBD TBD 2520 MHz 2505 MHz L2 Cache TBD TBD 72 MB 64 MB Memory Capacity 32 GB GDDR7 (+33%) 16 GB GDDR7 (0%) 24 GB GDDR6X 16 GB GDDR6X Memory Bus 512-bit (+33%) 256-bit (0%) 384-bit 256-bit Memory Speed 28-32 Gbps 32 Gbps 21.0 Gbps 23.0 Gbps Bandwidth 1792-2048 GB/s 1024 GB/s 1008 GB/s 736 GB/s TBP 600W (+33%) 400W (+25%) 450W 320W Power Interface 1 12V-2x6 (16-Pin) 1 12V-2x6 (16-Pin) 1 12VHPWR (16-Pin) 1 12VHPWR (16-Pin)\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 GPU are you looking forward to the most?

        "content": "\n\n\n\nIt's been rumored that Intel will unveil its Arc Battlemage GPUs in December, beating both AMD and NVIDIA to the punch with a next-generation graphics card lineup. Adding credence to the rumor is a listing on Amazon that apparently went live before it was supposed to. Amazon was somewhat quick to pull the listing, but not before we (and other sites) could yank some images.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe now-removed listing showed a custom card from ASRock, and specifically the ASRock Arc B580 Steel Legend variant, complete with what look to be official press renders of the card from several angles, as well as the retail box. In this particular trim, we're looking at a factory overclocked graphics card, and also clearly a Battlemage part as evidenced by the \"B580\" model name.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon listing (now removed) for an unannounced Arc B580 Battlemage GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's also confirmed by the specifications in the listing, which state the card is based on Intel's Xe2-HPG architecture. It's also revealed to feature 12GB of GDDR6 memory running at 19Gbps on a 192-bit memory bus, along with a GPU clock that's been goosed to 2.8GHz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming the memory specs are accurate, the memory bandwidth on this card should be 456GB/s—roughly half of a GeForce RTX 4090 (1.01TB/s), and nipping at the heels of a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti (504.2GB/s). As another reference point, the current-generation Arc A580 features 8GB of 16Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit bus, for 512GB/s of memory bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't mention what Intel's reference GPU clock speed is set at, so take your best guess. As a point of comparison, ASRock's Arc A580 Challenger OC edition card features an overclocked 2,000MHz GPU base clock, compared to Intel's 1,700MHz reference speed (ASRock doesn't make a Steel Legend version of the A580).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's worth noting that a supposed Arc Battlemage card with a 20-core GPU, 2.85GHz clock speed, and 12GB of VRAM found its way to Geekbench a few weeks ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few other details of note. For one, the listing highlights 8K resolution support, though don't expect the Arc B580 to truly be capable of high-end gaming at such a high res (or even 4K gaming, for the most part). Additionally, the listing reveals a three-fan cooling solution with RGB lighting, a metal backplate, and two 8-pin power connectors. We can also see three DisplayPort connectors and an HDMI output on the card's I/O.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe listing also mentions \"650W,\" which is undoubtedly in reference to the recommended power supply wattage. As for the card itself, each of the 8-pin power connectors can supply up to 150W, plus another 75W from the PCI Express x16 slot. So we're looking at an absolute maximum power draw of 375W.\n\n\n\n\n\nASRock's early listing never showed a price or release date, so those details (along with stock specs) remain a mystery. However, it's probably safe to assume that a formal Battlemage launch is imminent.\n\n",

In 2023, that number quintupled to more than $500,000.\n\nWhile Big Tech companies have spent millions lobbying in Washington, DC, on issues such as AI and antitrust regulation, the CHIPS and Science Act, which is set to give out more than $30 billion in incentives funding to chip companies, kicked things into high gear for the semiconductor industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican manufacturers like Intel and Micron boosted their lobbying funding, while foreign companies like TSMC assembled their DC-based government relations teams in response. And while chip designers like Nvidia and AMD are not direct CHIPS Act funding recipients, they hold an interest in shifting manufacturing dependence on TSMC in case of any geopolitical conflicts in Taiwan.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed lobbying public disclosure reports associated with various chip companies and focused on the top listed lobbyists and governmental affairs departments. Most members were part of the \"revolving door,\" switching from staffing on the hill, campaigns, and other agencies to the private sector.\n\n\"Given that more government policies are impacting the chip industry relative to several years ago–tariffs, incentives, tax policies, etc.— it isn't surprising that the chip industry is focusing more on this,\" said Chris Miller, the author of the book \"Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has scrambled to finalize CHIPS Act funding since the election of Donald Trump, who advocated for higher tariffs and attacked the bipartisan legislation in an interview with Joe Rogan in October.\n\nOnly three companies—Polar Semiconductor, Global Foundries, and TSMC—have finalized funding contracts out of 21 set to receive CHIPS Act grant funding. The Department of Commerce has awarded over $10 billion so far and expects to allocate all incentives funds this year, a Department spokesperson said.\n\nCompanies will push to finalize their CHIPS Act grants in the short term and try to build more connections with Republican policymakers in the long term, said Lori Yue, an associate management professor at Columbia Business School who studies corporate political strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Government change would definitely affect lobbying as the executive branch has a lot of power in terms of regulation,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Commerce spokesperson said that the due diligence and negotiation processes for finalizing funding are \"bespoke\" for each applicant. The spokesperson declined to comment on chip lobbying efforts and the specifics of individual CHIPS applicants.\n\nYue said that hiring lobbyists depends on what expertise and networks they already have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For example, they have worked on certain governmental issues before. They really know every single regulatory procedure on this issue. That person can be very valuable. Besides what they know is who they know: how can this person bring the company's perspective to the policymakers and connect to the person in power?\" said Yue.\n\nTrump nominated Howard Lutnick, CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and an advocate for tariffs, as his commerce secretary.",

        "content": "Jim Cramer Doubles Down On Nvidia: 'Demand Is Accelerating' As AI Customers 'Have No Choice' But To Buy Its Chips\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the artificial intelligence landscape, with CNBC’s Jim Cramer and Wall Street analysts reinforcing their bullish outlook following the company’s stellar third-quarter earnings report.\n\nWhat Happened: “The demand is accelerating because the payoff is so great,” Cramer said on Thursday, citing CEO Jensen Huang‘s assertion that customers earn five dollars for every dollar invested in Nvidia chips.\n\nThis compelling return on investment, Cramer argues, makes Nvidia’s products essential for major tech companies. “That means they have no choice but to buy Nvidia's chips,” he said.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nThe sentiment is echoed by Wedbush‘s Dan Ives, who called the results a “jaw-dropper.” Ives predicts the Nasdaq could surge to 25,000, driven by an extraordinary multiplier effect where “one dollar spent on GPU chips translates to an $8 to $10 impact across the tech sector.”\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia reported third-quarter revenue of $35.1 billion, up 94% year-over-year, with Data Center revenue alone reaching $30.8 billion. The company’s CFO Colette Kress projects gross margins will temporarily dip to the low 70% range as the new Blackwell systems ramp up production.\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a Buy rating while raising the price target from $200 to $220.\n\nThis optimism is reflected in a recent Benzinga poll, where 48% of respondents believed Nvidia would continue to dominate the “Magnificent Seven” stocks in 2025, followed by Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at 27%.\n\nHuang describes this period as “the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing,” highlighting the transition to machine learning and AI’s emergence as an industrial capability. The company projects fourth-quarter revenue of $37.5 billion, with Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) already planning AI computing clusters scaling to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.",
        "summary": "Jim Cramer and Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Nvidia's future, highlighting the company's strong third-quarter earnings and the increasing demand for its AI chips. Cramer emphasizes that Nvidia's chips offer a significant return on investment, making them indispensable for major tech companies. Analysts like Dan Ives predict that Nvidia's impact on the tech sector could drive the Nasdaq to new heights, with a substantial multiplier effect from GPU chip spending. Nvidia reported a 94% year-over-year revenue increase, with significant contributions from its Data Center segment, and projects further growth in the fourth quarter. Analysts maintain a positive outlook on Nvidia's stock, with expectations of continued dominance in the tech industry, particularly in AI and machine learning advancements.",

The AI boom, which has powered chipmakers such as Nvidia, and other big tech firms, has turbocharged global demand for infrastructure such as data centers and high-powered servers.Reuters reported in September that data center operator Switch is exploring an IPO that could value the company at about $40 billion, including debt.Funding for private AI and cloud startups in the US, Europe and Israel is rising after three years of decline, and is estimated to touch $79.2 billion by the end of this year, venture capital firm Accel said in October.CoreWeave offers access to data centers and high-powered chips for AI workloads, primarily supplied by Nvidia, one of the company's main backers. It competes against larger cloud computing service providers such as tech giant Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS.CoreWeave declined to comment.A broader wave of high-profile names is gearing up for potential listings next year, as the IPO market shows early signs of thawing after several bouts of market volatility shut down capital markets for much of the last two years.CoreWeave recently completed a $650 million secondary share sale, which valued it at $23 billion. Investors led by Jane Street, Magnetar, Fidelity Management, and Macquarie Capital participated in the secondary stock deal.Bloomberg reported in November that CoreWeave had tapped investment banks for its IPO preparations.",

        "content": "TL;DR: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card will use the GB202 \"Blackwell\" GPU, which is 22% larger than the AD102 \"Ada Lovelace\" GPU in the RTX 4090. The GB202 GPU. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card will use the GB202 \"Blackwell\" GPU, which is 22% larger than the AD102 \"Ada Lovelace\" GPU in the RTX 4090. The GB202 GPU.\n\nNVIDIA's next-generation GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card will use the GB202 \"Blackwell\" GPU, which is reportedly 744mm2 making it around 22% larger than the AD102 \"Ada Lovelace\" GPU inside of the current-gen flagship RTX 4090.\n\nIn a new post on X by leaker \"MEGAsizeGPU\" we hear that the GB202 GPU has a die size of 24x31, which measures out to 722mm2, with the GPU featuring a package size of 63x56, which is roughly 3528mm2. The GeForce RTX 4090 features the AD102 GPU which has a die size of 609mm2, and a package size of 2601mm2 (51x51mm). This means the GB202 GPU has a 22% increase in die size, and 35% increase in packaging area.\n\nNVIDIA's next-gen GeForce RTX 5090 and its GB202 GPU might sound huge, but the TU102 \"Turing\" GPU featured a 754mm2 die, and was the first to introduce the Tensor and RT Core technology on a GeForce Gaming GPU, with a reduction in die size during Turing, with improved process node optimization with each generation.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 details so far:\n\n20,000+ CUDA cores: With a rumored 21,760 CUDA cores, we're looking at a big upgrade over the 16,384 inside of the RTX 4090. Not just more CUDA cores, but upgraded Blackwell GPU architecture cores over the current Ada Lovelace GPU cores inside of the RTX 4090.\n\n32GB of next-gen GDDR7 memory: NVIDIA is the first to use the ultra-fast GDDR7 memory standard, with the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 pegged to have an incredible 32GB of GDDR7 memory. This is another big upgrade over the RTX 4090 which has 24GB of GDDR6X memory.\n\nUp to 2.0TB/sec memory bandwidth: We're hearing that the RTX 5090 will have a monster 512-bit memory bus, which enables an insane ceiling of up to 2.0TB/sec of memory bandwidth if the RTX 5090 uses 32Gbps GDDR7 memory modules. Another giant upgrade over the RTX 4090 which has 1.0TB/sec of memory bandwidth in comparison.\n\n600W of power: Another big upgrade for the RTX 5090 is the 600W of power, which is another 150W of power on top of the 450W TDP of the RTX 4090. We did see custom models and overclocked RTX 4090 cards pushing up to 600W+ of power, but the RTX 5090 is going to be another level again on top of that. Hopefully we see 600W+++ custom AIB models of the RTX 5090.\n\n4K performance: NVIDIA's next-generation ultimate gaming GPU in the GeForce RTX 5090 should have 50-70% more performance across the board compared to the RTX 4090, especially at the higher-end 4K resolution. 4K 120FPS gaming should be an even easier achievement for the RTX 5090 than it is for the RTX 4090. We've got 4K 240FPS coming this year and in 2025, so the RTX 5090 will be the GPU of choice for 4K 240FPS gaming in the future.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nRT performance: This is where the biggest performance improvements of the next-gen Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs will come: ray tracing. Expect some rather large 2-3x performance gains using RT, probably 4x or more in some cases with the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 against their RTX 40 series counterparts. Throw new DLSS 4 on top, and you've got some wowzers RT performance.\n\nDLSS 4: This is probably my personal favorite part of the excitement of next-gen GPUs from NVIDIA, AI-powered upscaling with a next-gen DLSS 4 that works only on the new Blackwell-based RTX 50 series GPUs. We should expect even higher image quality than offered by DLSS 3.x and new levels of performance with DLSS 4 enabled on a new RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 graphics card.\n\nPower efficiency: NVIDIA's current-gen GeForce RTX 4090 can use anywhere between 450W and 600W of power depending on the model and overclocking, but the new GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs will offer far more performance-per-watt of the leading RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 SUPER graphics cards. Another exciting part to see unravel in the near future.",
        "summary": "The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card will feature the GB202 \"Blackwell\" GPU, which is 22% larger than the AD102 \"Ada Lovelace\" GPU in the RTX 4090, with a die size of 744mm² and a package size of 3528mm². It will boast over 21,760 CUDA cores, a significant upgrade from the RTX 4090's 16,384, and will include 32GB of next-gen GDDR7 memory, offering up to 2.0TB/sec memory bandwidth. The RTX 5090 will have a power consumption of 600W, which is 150W more than the RTX 4090, and is expected to deliver 50-70% more performance, particularly in 4K gaming.

It is the foundation of social advancement and scientific advancement,\" Huang told media during a visit to Hong Kong.\n\nGlobal cooperation is \"going to continue. I don't know what's going to happen in the new administration, but whatever happens, we'll balance simultaneously compliance with laws and policies, continue to advance our technology and support and serve customers all over the world.\"\n\nEarlier on Saturday Huang told graduates and academics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology that \"the age of AI has started\" in a speech after receiving an honorary doctorate degree in engineering.\n\nThe head of the world's leading maker of chips used for artificial intelligence applications received the award alongside actor Tony Leung, Nobel Prize for Chemistry winner Prof. Michael Levitt and Fields Medallist Prof. David Mumford.\n\n\"The age of AI has started. A new computing era that will impact every industry and every field of science,\" said Huang.\n\nHe said Nvidia has \"reinvented computing and sparked a new industrial revolution,\" 25 years after inventing the graphics processing unit.\n\n\"AI is certainly the most important technology of our time, and potentially of all times.\"\n\nHuang, 61, also told graduates that he wished he had started his career at this time.\n\n\"The whole world is reset. You're at the starting lines with everybody else. An industry is being reinvented. You now have the instruments, the instruments necessary to advance science in so many different fields,\" Huang said.\n\n\"The greatest challenges of our time, unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past, all of a sudden seem possible to tackle.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, Huang will participate in a fireside chat with the university's Council Chairman Harry Sham, teachers and students.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2024",

(Photo: Pornprom Satrabhaya)\n\nRECAP: Asian equities rose on Friday, with technology stocks in the region rebounding from a selloff that had been prompted by concerns over the revenue outlook for Nvidia Corp.\n\nThai shares little changed from a week earlier, as investors fretted about Donald Trump's tariff policies and awaited news of more domestic economic stimulus.\n\nThe SET Index moved in a range of 1,435.78 and 1,471.48 points this week before closing on Friday at 1,446.30, up 0.3% from the previous week, with daily turnover averaging 42.93 billion baht. Brokers were net buyers of 2.39 billion baht, followed by foreign investors at 1.02 billion baht. Retail investors were net sellers of 2.9 billion baht and institutions 511.16 million.\n\nNEWSMAKERS: Gold had its best week in a year, gaining 5% on safe-haven demand amid escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war. Spot gold hit $2,687 an ounce after reports that Russia had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on Ukraine.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree approving the use of tactical nuclear weapons following Ukraine's use of US long-range missiles to strike deep into Russian territory.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced a ¥22-trillion ($142 billion) stimulus package covering wage increases, cash handouts to low-income households, semiconductor and AI investment support and energy subsidies.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund warns that retaliatory tariffs between the US and China would undermine Asia's economic opportunities, hurting export-dependent countries, eroding supply chain efficiency and driving up US inflation.\n\nThe parent of the Chinese e-commerce platform Temu, PDD Holdings, said sales growth slowed amid intensified competition and consumer caution in its home market. Revenue in the quarter to Sept 30 was 99.4 billion yuan ($13.7 billion), up 44% from a year earlier.\n\nApple Inc has offered to raise its investment in Indonesia tenfold to $100 million within two years in exchange for lifting a ban on sales of the iPhone 16.\n\nNvidia's third-quarter results exceeded market expectations, with total revenue up 94% year-on-year, driven by 112% growth in data centre business. However, concerns about overheating in a new AI chip could delay data centre launches.\n\nThailand is entering a prime period for investment, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra told the Forbes Global CEO Conference. She announced five stimulus measures for the short and long term, focusing on real estate, infrastructure, agricultural sector upgrades, tourism promotion and private investment support to address economic restructuring.\n\nHousehold non-performing loans (NPLs) rose 14% year-on-year to 1.2 trillion baht in the third quarter, while there are growing concerns over the bad debt of small businesses, which rose 20%, according to the National Credit Bureau.\n\nThailand's economy grew in the third quarter by 3%, driven by non-agricultural production, services and accelerated government investment, said the National Economic and Social Development Council. But it has revised down its full-year forecast to 2.6% from 2.5% and projects just 2.8% growth in 2025. Risks include Donald Trump's economic policies and high household and business debt levels.\n\nThe University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce estimates that 60% US tariffs on Chinese goods, if they materialise, would cause economic damage of 160 billion baht to Thailand. Exports would drop 1.5% and GDP growth would be 0.9 percentage points lower than projections.\n\nA Board of Investment team has visited Shanghai to attract investment amid Chinese company concerns over US election results. They met with battery and electronics companies to promote Thailand as a production base.

        "content": "NVIDIA's Blackwell GB202 GPU for the GeForce RTX 5090 Flagship will see a hefty die size increase versus the existing Ada flagship.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090's GPU Will Be 22% Larger Than RTX 4090, GB202 Chip With 744mm2 Die Size\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card will be the flagship solution within the GeForce RTX 50 \"Blackwell\" gaming lineup. This chip is expected to bring in some huge gains over the RTX 4090, but it looks like the chip will also be gargantuan in terms of die size while making use of TSMC's 5nm process node.\n\nGB202 Die Size 24*31\n\nPackage Size 63*56 — MEGAsizeGPU (@Zed__Wang) November 22, 2024\n\nAccording to MEGAsizeGPU, the NVIDIA GB202 GPU which will be featured on the RTX 5090 will be roughly 24x31mm in terms of die size, which totals to 744 mm2. The GPU will feature a package size of 63x65mm which is roughly 3528mm2. For reference, the RTX 4090's AD102 GPU featured a die size of 609mm2 and a package size of 2601mm2 (51x51mm). This is a 22% increase in the die size and a 35% increase in the packaging area.\n\nNow a bigger die size doesn't mean that the chip will eventually be more power-hungry or run hot, but it should be remembered that it is still a smaller die size than the 754mm2 Turing TU102 chip which was launched with the first generation RTX \"20\" cards. The chip included Tensor and RT core technology for the first time on an NVIDIA GeForce \"Gaming\" GPU and since then, we have seen a reduction in die size for flagship chips for each consecutive process node optimization.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 32 GB Graphics Card\n\nStarting with the details, we first have the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, which is going to be the top GPU in the lineup. The graphics card is expected to feature the PG144/145-SKU30 PCB design & that's going to incorporate the GB202-300-A1 GPU core. The GPU will have 170 SMs enabled out of the total 192 SMs and will feature 21760 cores instead of the total of 24,576 cores. This marks an 11.4% reduction, which is slightly more than the11.1% reduction of the RTX 4090 versus its full AD102 die.\n\nOn the memory side, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is going to be a beast with 32 GB of GDDR7 VRAM capacity running across a 512-bit interface. The VRAM will operate at 28 Gbps speeds for up to 1792 GB/s of bandwidth plus a bigger L3 cache and new memory compression techniques are also going to boost the overall bandwidth available to the GPU. The card will also come with a 600W TBP rating, though it should be mentioned that the TBP value shouldn't be compared with actual real-world or gaming power consumption as that ends up much lower. Previous leaks have suggested a 2-slot cooler for the Founders Edition model of the RTX 5090.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is expected to launch at CES 2025 so expect more information in the coming months.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 GPU Specs (Preliminary):\n\nGraphics Card Name NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU Name Blackwell GB202-300 Blackwell GB203-400 Blackwell GB205 Blackwell GB206?

This is a hefty hint that the Blackwell flagship could be close at hand. Comino has revealed liquid-cooled workstations and servers with Nvidia RTX 5090 graphics cards, which you can register your interest in buying now. This is a hefty hint that the Blackwell flagship could be close at hand.\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 5090 has popped up on pre-order, kind of - not as a standalone product, of course, but as part of seriously powerful liquid-cooled servers and workstations from a vendor called Comino.\n\n2\n\nFill in the form to 'secure your spot' and grab one of these heavyweight beasts from Comino (Image Credit: Comino)\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nThe revelation came courtesy of a press release from Comino, spotted by Tom's Hardware, offering 'priority access' to would-be buyers of these workstations, so you can \"be among the first to harness RTX 5090 power.\"\n\nComino explains:\n\n\"Comino is excited to open pre-orders for our next-generation liquid-cooled workstations and servers featuring the NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs.\n\n\"Designed for top performance, these systems are trusted by leading companies and reviewers. Built to thrive in harsh environments of up to 40°C, they deliver 100% performance and beyond, 24/7.\"\n\nComino's Grando server, which is equipped with eight RTX 5090 graphics cards, can be 'pre-ordered' via email or an online form, but as you might expect, this is more about registering your interest at this point - and providing details of the project you plan to use the system with. You'll then get an ETA for the arrival of your server (and stock will be limited to begin with, unsurprisingly).\n\nThere's certainly no pricing given yet, so we can't guess at what the RTX 5090 might pitch up at cost-wise.\n\nIt's still quite exciting to see the (potentially power-hungry) RTX 5090 actually mentioned in the spec of an upcoming product, though, and we can take this as a sign that the Blackwell flagship is indeed on the verge of arriving. Maybe a bit sooner than we thought, even?\n\nAfter all, while most rumors pin the reveal date of the RTX 5090 as CES 2025 - with the RTX 5080 and perhaps even the RTX 5070 in tow - maybe this is a hint that other speculation, which suggested a late 2024 launch, might just be correct, after all. Obviously take that idea with a big old shovel full of seasoning.",

        "content": "Generative AI is transforming every aspect of the automotive industry, including software development, testing, user experience, personalization, and safety. With the automotive industry shifting from a mechanically driven approach to a software-driven one, generative AI is unlocking a world of possibilities.\n\nTata Consultancy Services (TCS) focuses on two major segments for leveraging generative AI in automotive:\n\nBuilding features to enhance customer experience\n\nAccelerating the software engineering lifecycle\n\nBuilding features to enhance customer experience\n\nGenerative AI is the key to realizing fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) by enhancing AI-based algorithms for better decision-making. It generates and synthesizes datasets across all possibilities, from limited real-time data to training and testing data. This technology is instrumental in delivering vehicle personalization and user experiences. This can encompass a range of capabilities, including advanced search functionalities, language translations, in-car personal assistants, and intuitive recommendations for video and audio entertainment.\n\nAccelerating the software engineering lifecycle\n\nThe goal of a software-defined vehicle (SDV) is to provide more flexibility and enrich the user experience, enabling customers to upgrade and update vehicle features based on their convenience. This has increased vehicle complexity, resulting in millions of lines of code. There is high demand for enabling feature-as-a-service models, where automotive features need to be developed and deployed within a few weeks.\n\nCurrent processes and tools make this timeline nearly impossible. Here, generative AI has the potential to act as a companion to engineers, accelerating the software engineering lifecycle, including requirement analysis, design, development, and validation.\n\nWith these focus areas, TCS has built the Automotive Gen-AI Suite, leveraging TCS-patented algorithms developed with NVIDIA technologies. Figure 1 shows the architecture for text-based use cases in an off-board environment. Large language models (LLMs) are trained with the NVIDIA NeMo framework and fine-tuned using automotive domain-specific datasets using NVIDIA NIM microservices, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\n\nThis post explores one use case, unit level test case generation, including the approach and the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure success.\n\nFigure 1. The architecture of the TCS Automotive Gen-AI solution leverages a variety of NVIDIA technologies\n\nTest case generation from unstructured requirements\n\nCreating test cases from unstructured system requirements is one of the most time-consuming steps within the software engineering lifecycle.\n\nFigure 2. Source text and target text for test case generation\n\nCurrently, creating test case repositories for various automotive domains are mostly done manually, which is time-consuming and costly. Training and development of these test cases can take weeks.\n\nTo solve this industry-wide problem, TCS is using NVIDIA technologies to automatically generate test cases from unstructured text-based requirements.\n\nLLMs can speed up the process and reduce costs with minimal intervention during validation. It can generate scenarios and corresponding test cases, which can then be validated by experts for accuracy and coverage.To generate test cases tailored to specific requirements, TCS carefully curates the dataset using an iterative process where TCS analyzes the output of a pretrained model and selects data, such as cases with lower accuracy or coverage, for further refinement. Using the NVIDIA NeMo framework, TCS fine-tunes the model on automotive-specific data using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Prompt selection is also a critical step, with prompt tuning incorporated to optimize KPIs.\n\nFor deployment, TCS uses NVIDIA NIM microservices on NVIDIA DGX H100 systems. The preprocessed input prompt is fed into a fine-tuned NeMo-based model, which has been trained with automotive knowledge. The base model used for fine-tuning is the Llama 3 8B Instruct model. After postprocessing, the output consists of test cases that help customers enhance their capabilities, serving as a companion tool.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the overall approach, from input requirements to output test cases. Input is preprocessed with techniques such as few-shot learning and prompt chaining. Context awareness for each use case is achieved using reference documents from the customer during the preprocessing steps, employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.\n\nFigure 3. Approach for the test case generation from requirements\n\nThe training pipeline includes domain and task-specific curated data blocks, which, after cleaning, are fed into the fine-tuning block. This block utilizes PEFT with LoRA, rank 32, and the NVIDIA NeMo framework (NeMo: 24.05 container) with a fused Adam optimizer. The model is trained with steps ranging from 1 to 100 to prevent overfitting. TCS deploys the fine-tuned model using the NVIDIA NIM (Meta/Llama3-8b-instruct: 1.0.0) container. The generated output is then postprocessed and integrated with LangChain to produce the required output test cases.\n\nOptimizing with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform\n\nTCS has leveraged NVIDIA NeMo to build these state-of-the-art models. The base LLMs were fine-tuned with our automotive-specific curated datasets using the LoRA technique. The fine-tuning was performed in the NeMo framework training container to improve GPU utilization.\n\nUsing NVIDIA NIM-based optimization, TCS achieved low latency (close to real time) and high throughput on NVIDIA DGX systems. Post-training quantization using NIM microservices including NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM helps reduce GPU utilization and latency. NIM also provides inferencing APIs, which can be directly invoked from application services.\n\nBenchmarks to identify the best model\n\nA comparison study of GPU utilization, training parameters, and output accuracies for TCS test case generator pipeline on different LLMs was conducted to select the most appropriate ones.\n\nThe TCS test case generation pipeline using NeMo starts with an input, which can be a specifications document from the customer, or a prompt based on these specs.\n\nThese inputs are fed to the LLM NIM microservices fine-tuned with auto-specific data.\n\nThe generated output is verified for incorrect and duplicate test cases. If needed, a new prompt is used to correct or generate more test cases, and the process is repeated.\n\nAccuracy and coverage are used for comparison.\n\nIn terms of latency, on average NIM based inference is around 2.5x to 3x faster than other open-source-based direct inference scenarios with similar accuracies.\n\nFigure 4 shows a comparison of pretrained models to help users identify the best model for a given use case and select the most suitable base model for the requirement. This comparison includes not just accuracy and number of test cases but also decision coverage, condition coverage, and Modified Condition Decision Coverage (MCDC).\n\nFigure 4. Comparison of pretrained models based on accuracy and average number of test cases\n\n*Considering requirements of test case scenario only\n\nDecision coverage\n\nDecision coverage evaluates decision points within a model, such as switch blocks or flow states, by calculating the percentage of simulation paths traversed during testing. Full coverage is achieved when all possible paths through these decision points are executed at least once.\n\nCondition coverage\n\nCondition coverage examines the logical combinations of inputs and state flow transitions. Full coverage is obtained when each input and transition condition in the model is tested to be both true and false at least once during the simulation.\n\nMCDC\n\nMCDC assesses the independence of logical inputs and transition conditions in a model. Full coverage is achieved when a change in one input or condition, independent of others, directly causes a change in the model’s output or triggers a transition.\n\nTable 1 provides insight into why choosing the Llama 3 8B Instruct model fine-tuned with NVIDIA NIM in this case outperforms on accuracy, decision, and MCDC criteria. Note that online model inferencing and fine-tuning were not in the scope of this work, as the customer data is sensitive and all the training and inference TCS conducted was on offline mode only using TCS on-premises NVIDIA DGX H100 systems.\n\n\n\nComparison considering base as Llama 3 8B Instruct\n\n(pretrained versus fine-tuned)* Model Accuracy Decision Condition MCDC Llama 3 8B Instruct NVIDIA NIM pretrained 87% 84.5% 88.56% 71.22% Llama 3 8B Instruct NVIDIA NIM fine-tuned 91% 85.1% 87.89% 73.11% Table 1. Comparison of pretrained and fine-tuned Llama 3 8B Instruct model\n\n*Considering requirements of test case scenario only\n\nUsing LLMs can reduce the cost and time for the training and development of automotive software. With minimal manual intervention, LLMs help understand the key requirements and write automated test cases. They can also generate scenarios and test cases, which experts can then validate for accuracy and coverage.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the expertise in the generative AI and automotive domains, TCS has developed a highly efficient automotive test case generation pipeline using NVIDIA DGX H100 systems and software including NVIDIA NIM and NVIDIA NeMo. This model, fine-tuned with the NVIDIA NeMo framework, along with faster inference possible with NIM, resulted in accuracies and coverage higher than that of existing models available with low latency. TCS has observed ~2x acceleration in its overall test case generation pipeline.\n\nTCS is also using NeMo and NIM to advance conversational LLMs, visual LLMs for context understanding, and image-based generative adversarial network models. TCS also will be using NVIDIA Blueprints to explore multimodal capabilities and will further refine the software engineering lifecycle.",

        "content": "Support IPWatchdog with an individual sponsorship: Click here\n\n“While eBay has raised the bar for obtaining injunctive relief in patent cases, Xockets’ arguments suggest that the remedy remains within reach, albeit challenging.”\n\nXockets, Inc. recently filed a complaint in the Western District of Texas against NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”), Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) and RPX Corporation (“RPX”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for alleged patent infringement and violation of federal antitrust laws. As is often the case in patent cases, Xockets seeks an injunction in addition to monetary damages. But how realistic is it for Xockets to obtain an injunction under the current legal landscape, especially with the hurdles posed by modern judicial standards? In this article, we delve into the complexities surrounding injunctive relief in patent cases that are sure to impact Xockets’ chances of obtaining an injunction in a post-eBay world.\n\nXockets’ Case\n\nWith respect to its patent allegations, Xockets asserts seven patents relating to various data processing unit (DPU) inventions, including cloud computing architecture and cloud network fabric in order to increase computing system speeds, lower costs of distributed computing services, and isolate critical data-intensive tasks that would otherwise overburden server processors.. Xockets targets NVIDIA’s DPU-enabled cloud computer systems, including its Hopper and Blackwell GPU graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled server computer systems and its BlueField and ConnectX DPUs.. Xockets further alleges that Microsoft’s use of NVIDIA’s infringing products within its Microsoft Azure Cloud platform also infringes Xockets’ patents.\n\nThe gravamen of Xockets’ antitrust claims centers on the allegation that NVIDIA, Microsoft and RPX colluded to monopolize the artificial intelligence computer systems market, which includes Xockets’ patented technology. Specifically, Xockets alleges that as a result of Defendants’ market power, Defendants have “formed a cartel to create and/or maintain a monopoly in GPU-enabled generative artificial intelligence.” Xockets alleges that RPX facilitates the cartel.\n\nIn addition to monetary damages, Xockets seeks injunctive relief. Xockets seeks to enjoin NVIDIA from releasing its new Blackwell GPU-enabled server computer systems, which is set to release during the fourth quarter of this year, and Microsoft’s use of the accused NVIDIA products. Xockets argues that “injunctive relief ‘serves both as a deterrent to patent infringement and facilitates market transactions in which fair market value is set through commercial negotiations,’” and “‘the loss of injunction to stop violations of property rights also devalues property in the marketplace, it is simply worth less given that it offers less protection to its owner.’”\n\nThe Evolution of U.S. Injunctions\n\n\n\nIf Xockets were to succeed in proving liability, it would then need to meet four criteria to obtain a permanent injunction: (1) it has suffered irreparable harm; (2) monetary damages are insufficient to adequately address this harm; (3) the balance of hardships between the parties favors granting an injunction; and (4) issuing an injunction would not harm the public interest.\n\nPrior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2006 decision on eBay Inc. v. MercExchange LLC, courts granted injunctions, almost as a matter of course, upon a finding of patent infringement. However, in eBay, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively abrogated the Federal Circuit’s “general rule” of favoring injunctions subsequent to an infringement finding, ruling it inconsistent to the statutory language of the Patent Act and intruding on district court’s discretion in deciding whether to issue a permanent injunction. The Court held that the traditional four-factor test described above applied equally to disputes arising under the Patent Act and each case ought to be decided on its merits. Following eBay in 2006, courts in patent infringement cases have increasingly focused on policy concerns related to injunctions. In recent years, there has been a prevailing perception that courts are generally reluctant to grant injunctive relief in such cases. However, this perception is not entirely accurate. Before the eBay decision, courts granted injunctive relief in approximately 94-100% of patent cases where the trier of fact found infringement. See Eric Maughan, Protecting the Rights of Inventors: How Natural Rights Theory Should Influence the Injunction Analysis in Patent Infringement Cases, 10 Geo. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 215, 224 (2012). While the frequency of permanent injunctions has declined since then, companies continue to secure injunctive relief across the nation, demonstrating that it remains a viable remedy for protecting market share and reputation. According to Lex Machina, once the trier of fact has found infringement, courts have granted permanent injunctions in 394 of the 454 patent cases (87%) from January 2007 to November 2024.\n\nIn addition to the traditional four-factor test for injunctive relief, courts have also considered four additional criteria when deciding whether to grant injunctions in patent cases. First, courts are significantly less likely to grant an injunction where the patent holder does not practice the patent. A study by Professor Christopher Seaman of Washington and Lee School of Law found that non practicing entities are generally not successful in obtaining injunctive relief, whereas practicing entities secured injunctions in 80% of cases. See Christopher B. Seaman, Permanent Injunctions in Patent Litigation After eBay: An Empirical Study, 101 Iowa L. Rev. 1949, 1988, fig. 3 (2016).\n\nSecond, courts are less inclined to grant injunctions when the parties are not competitors in the marketplace. Professor Seaman’s research shows that patent holders who competed with an infringer were granted a permanent injunction in the overwhelming majority of cases (84%), while patent holders who were not market competitors succeeded in obtaining injunctive relief only 21% of the time. See Permanent Injunctions in Patent Litigation After eBay: An Empirical Study at 1988, fig. 3.\n\nThird, courts appear to take into account the type of patent involved when deciding on injunctions. According to Professor Seaman, permanent injunctions are mostly commonly granted in cases involving biotechnology or pharmaceutical patents. However, district courts granted injunctions in only about two-thirds of cases involving electronics and medical device patents and even less frequently in cases involving computer software patents (53%). Id. at 1984-85.\n\nFinally, courts are much less likely to grant injunctions when the infringing component constitutes only a small part of the overall product in question.\n\nXockets’ Chances\n\nIn Xockets’ case, the four additional criteria that courts consider for granting injunctions in patent cases post-eBay could support Xockets’ position; provided there is a finding of liability. First, Xockets claims to practice its patents. In its complaint, Xockets states, “[t]he release of NVIDIA’s new Blackwell architecture-based systems will cause additional irreparable harm to Xockets through further eradication of Xockets’ footprint in this incredibly valuable, emerging technology market; devaluation of Xockets’ patent rights by NVIDIA’s unauthorized and extensive use of Xockets’ properly-granted exclusive rights and destruction of Xockets’ business opportunities.”\n\nSecond, while Xockets concedes that it is a smaller market player compared to NVIDIA and Microsoft, it alleges that it competes directly with them. Xockets further asserts, “[t]he transaction costs of enforcing patent rights are substantial when combined with large asymmetries in bargaining power between market-controlling entities like NVIDIA and small business inventors like Xockets,” and such substantial litigation costs “discourage investments in innovation.”\n\nWhile the third factor does not favor Xockets, given that injunctions for computer software patents are granted around 53% of the time upon a finding of infringement, the fourth factor strengthens Xockets’ arguments as the infringing technology is alleged to be the main component of the accused products. Xockets further asserts that “[a]warding injunctive relief serves the public interest, because it holds the infringers accountable and rewards innovation. Absent injunctive relief, infringers are incentivized to practice ‘efficient infringement’ or ‘predatory infringement’ as opposed to engaging in good faith licensing negotiations, because failure to do so lacks any real consequence.”\n\nRESTORE Could Change the Game\n\nThe challenges in obtaining permanent injunctions post-eBay have prompted legislative action aimed at restoring stronger protections for patent owners. For example, in July 2024, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced the “Realizing Engineering, Science, and Technology Opportunities by Restoring Exclusive (RESTORE) Patent Rights Act of 2024.” This bipartisan legislation aims to address the challenges patent holders face in securing injunctive relief following eBay. The RESTORE Act seeks to amend Section 283 of Title 35 of the United States Code by introducing a rebuttable presumption in favor of granting a permanent injunction upon a finding of patent infringement. This change would shift the burden to the infringer to demonstrate why an injunction should not be issued, thereby strengthening the enforcement rights of patent owners. The bill has garnered support from various stakeholders, including the Innovation Alliance and the Association of University Technology Managers, who argue that it will deter predatory infringement and promote innovation by ensuring that inventors can effectively protect their intellectual property rights. See Innovation Alliance Applauds Introduction of RESTORE Patent Rights Act. The RESTORE Act is still in the early stages and we will continue to follow it.\n\nIn the meantime, while eBay has raised the bar for obtaining injunctive relief in patent cases, Xockets’ arguments suggest that the remedy remains within reach, albeit challenging. By grounding its arguments in the practical impact of irreparable harm, competitive positioning and the broader implications for innovation, Xockets seeks to leverage the evolving standards courts apply to balance equitable relief with the complexities of today’s technology market. This case may serve as a valuable benchmark for how courts continue to navigate the delicate balance between protecting patent rights and fostering an environment that encourages fair competition and technological advancement.\n\nShould the court grant Xockets’ injunction, the decision could have meaningful ramifications for NVIDIA considering that the Blackwell platform is expected to increased demand for all NVIDIA product infrastructure, thereby contributing to its $22.6 billion Data Center revenue, up 427% from a year ago. See NVIDIA’s April 2024 10-Q filing. Ultimately, the court’s decision could illuminate the flexibility of the eBay precedent in addressing modern patent disputes and may offer further insights into the path forward for innovators seeking to protect their intellectual property, including against industry giants.\n\nImage Source: Deposit Photos\n\nAuthor: Wavebreakmedia\n\nImage ID: 81996574",

        "content": "Those headline above includes strong words from the maker of the best graphics cards you can buy, and they have extra significance considering where Nvidia sits today in relation to Intel. But in 1997, things were a bit different. The quote comes from the upcoming book The Nvidia Way, written by columnist Tae Kim, and was shared as part of an excerpt ahead of the book’s release next month.\n\nThe words from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came as part of an all-hands meeting at the company in 1997 following the launch of the RIVA 128. This was prior to the release of the GeForce 256, when Nvidia finally coined the term “GPU,” and it was a precarious time for the new company. Shortly following the release of the RIVA 128, Intel launched its own i740, which came with an 8MB frame buffer. The RIVA 128 came with only a 4MB frame buffer.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n“Make no mistake. Intel is out to get us and put us out of business,” Huang said at the time. “They have told their employees, and they have internalized this. They are going to put us out of business. Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel.”\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nThe excerpt describes a wild company culture at Nvidia in the late 1990s, with Huang cited as often working 15-hour days, along with many of his employees. Part of the reason for that feeling of wildness, according to the excerpt, is how Huang would “unload on the first person he encountered” each morning. In one example, the excerpt describes Huang standing next to an employee at a urinal and asking what they’re working on. “I’m going to get fired because he thinks I’m not doing anything,” Nvidia’s Kenneth Hurley thought at the time.\n\nIt’s a fascinating look inside a business that has quickly become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Nvidia currently is the wealthiest company in the world with a $3.5 trillion market cap, though it often trades places with Apple and Microsoft — the only other companies in the world with a market cap above $3 trillion.\n\nThe revelation about Nvidia’s standing against Intel is especially interesting in 2024. Intel is in one of the worst financial positions it has ever been. On top of that, Nvidia’s CEO is now worth more than all of Intel. At the time, Intel was very much in a similar position that Nvidia is in today, dominating the PC market across corporate and consumer markets. Now, it’s a question of who is gunning for Nvidia’s crown.",
        "summary": "The excerpt from the upcoming book \"The Nvidia Way\" by Tae Kim highlights a pivotal moment in Nvidia's history during the late 1990s when the company was in fierce competition with Intel. In 1997, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang motivated his team with strong words, emphasizing the threat Intel posed to their business following the launch of Nvidia's RIVA 128 and Intel's i740 graphics cards. The book describes a demanding and intense company culture at Nvidia, with Huang working long hours and expecting the same from his employees. Today, Nvidia has become one of the most valuable companies globally, often trading places with Apple and Microsoft in terms of market capitalization. The narrative contrasts Nvidia's current success with Intel's financial struggles, highlighting the shift in market dominance over the years.",

While the lineup is slated to be released by 2025, Comino, which is a company dealing in liquid-cooled workstation systems, has started to take orders for its \"Grando Server,\" which features 8x of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 GPUs, marking the first occasion where we have seen the appearance of Team Green's next-gen flagship GPU in the retail channel.\n\nTo get your pre-order, Comino has uploaded a form to fill out, which requires essential details to get involved in the process. However, the firm hasn't mentioned the exact specifications of its system yet, apart from the fact that it uses eight of NVIDIA's RTX 5090 SKUs. It's important to note that the GPU is set to be released somewhere in Q1 2025, and pre-orders for a consumer GPU usually hint towards something illegitimate. Hence, buyers should be cautious before proceeding with such orders.\n\nImage Source: Comino\n\nAnother possibility here is that Comino might have started to take pre-orders to get an idea of what demand it is anticipating for its servers, and given that the company is an \"official\" NVIDIA partner, it might get some sort of exclusive treatment. Yet, it is highly advisable to wait for the official launch to occur before ordering such a system, given that by then, the details of the onboard GPU would be much more specific.\n\nSpeaking of details, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 is rumored to be equipped with cutting-edge capabilities, including the likes of 32 GB GDDR7 VRAM across a 512-bit interface and GPU operating speeds of up to 28 Gbps, for up to 1792 GB/s of bandwidth, which depicts towards the fact that this particular SKU will debut with \"mind-blowing\" performance. Other rumored details include TBPs of up to 600W and the use of 12V-2x6 power connectors. If interested, you can view our roundup on the GeForce RTX 5090 here.\n\nImage Source: Comino\n\nGiven that Comino has started to take pre-orders for a GeForce RTX 5090 workstation, we expect other manufacturers to follow, which does show us how \"close\" we are to the official launch.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 & RTX 5080 GPU Specs (Rumor):\n\nGraphics Card Name NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU Name Blackwell GB202-300 Blackwell GB203-400 Ada Lovelace AD102-300 Ada Lovelace AD103-300 GPU SMs 170 (192 Full) 84 (84 Full) 128 (144 Full) 76 *80 Full) GPU Cores 21760 (+33%) 10752 (+11%) 16384 9728 Clock Speeds TBD TBD 2520 MHz 2505 MHz L2 Cache TBD TBD 72 MB 64 MB Memory Capacity 32 GB GDDR7 (+33%) 16 GB GDDR7 (0%) 24 GB GDDR6X 16 GB GDDR6X Memory Bus 512-bit (+33%) 256-bit (0%) 384-bit 256-bit Memory Speed 28-32 Gbps 32 Gbps 21.0 Gbps 23.0 Gbps Bandwidth 1792-2048 GB/s 1024 GB/s 1008 GB/s 736 GB/s TBP 600W (+33%) 400W (+25%) 450W 320W Power Interface 1 12V-2x6 (16-Pin) 1 12V-2x6 (16-Pin) 1 12VHPWR (16-Pin) 1 12VHPWR (16-Pin)\n\nNews Source: Tomshardware\n\nProducts mentioned in this post ASUS GeForce RTX 4090 USD 1,912",

According to the company’s Form 10-Q, 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — came from only three unnamed customers.

That means Customers B and C have each spent around $10 billion on Nvidia’s tech so far this year, while Customer D has spent almost $11 billion. Nvidia reported revenues of $26 billion for the fiscal first quarter, and $30 billion for the fiscal second quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to the filing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September, Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing showed four anonymous customers made up nearly half of its $30 billion revenues for the second fiscal quarter. Sales from the four customers represented about 46% of total quarterly revenue, or $13.8 billion.\n\n“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in both 10-Q filings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-1.74% ) , Meta (META-0.73% ) , Microsoft (MSFT+1.01% ) , and Tesla (TSLA+3.75% ) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom.\n\nNvidia’s record fiscal third-quarter revenue was up 94% from a year ago.

        "content": "Gamers may be in for a tough time concerning GPU upgrades with the next generation, with NVIDIA stating that there could be a shortage of its RTX 50-series GPUs coming down the pipe. If you don’t remember the GPU shortage from just a few years ago, it was a time of high prices and high stress. Finding a GPU at its MSRP was nigh impossible, scalpers ran rampant with large stockpiles of graphics cards and were charging two or three times the price.\n\nWhich meant you either had to pay those exorbitant and downright offensive asking prices, or you had to wait for more stock. I was put on a waiting list for 10 months before I was able to secure an RTX 3060 (this was the current GPU series at the time and the card was only a few months old). Even if you did wait, there was no guarantee you would get a card. I got lucky with how EVGA was running its restocking process. It was the Wild West and if you wanted to upgrade your PC with a new GPU, getting one was basically left up to fate.\n\nIt’s not clear if things will get that bad again with regard to NVIDIA GPUs. However, it does seem like there may be less to go around with the company’s next-gen cards, slated for release in 2025. And it might be down to NVIDIA designating a large amount of the Blackwell GPUs to companies who want GPUs capable of powring high-performance AI applications.\n\nThe NVIDIA GPU shortage may cause price increases for current stock\n\nAlthough NVIDIA has warned gamers of potential GPU shortages, it’s important to remember that it might not be that bad. Nevertheless, it’s going to be prudent to prepare for the possibility. As Digital Trends points out, NVIDIA has said in its recent earnings call that fourth-quarter revenue may decline due to supply constraints. This is after a relatively positive growth in revenue for the third quarter.\n\nThe important detail here is the supply constraints. NVIDIA is expecting the supply of its 50-series GPUs to be lower than the 40-series GPUs that are available right now. And with both gamers and Enterprise looking to upgrade to NVIDIA’s new powerful option, it might impact the prices of current generation stock. Especially with the holidays coming up and the holiday shopping season in full swing.\n\nIn short, prepare for potential price increases. Some cards are available at reasonable prices for the moment, but that could change. And there’s no guarantee that if prices do go up, they will be limited to NVIDIA’s Founders Edition models. However, you can certainly expect those to be impacted heavily. As they have been since the 30-series.\n\nThe shortage may not last long\n\nHere’s the kicker with any shortage. It’s only really a bad thing if you have no patience. If you can weather the drought, then you can come out on top with a brand-new GPU that you didn’t overpay for. The good news is that NVIDIA has alluded to the fact that a shortage may not last long. The company says that it expects production to ramp up in early 2025. This should help costs on GPUs come back down if they increase significantly in the first place.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how this will impact the cost of older GPUs. An increase in 50-series GPU production early next year should cause decreased prices of 40-series GPUs. Again, that’s assuming they see a significant price increase. Either way, the point is, to make plans to secure a GPU now if you’re ready to upgrade now. Even if you aren’t, it might be wise to buy while prices are reasonable. It’s either that or risk paying more in a couple of months.\n\nThen again, those with 30-series GPUs are still fine. Especially those who own the Ti version of the RTX 3080 and 3090 (games still run pretty well on those).",
        "summary": "NVIDIA has warned of a potential shortage of its upcoming RTX 50-series GPUs, reminiscent of the previous GPU shortage that led to high prices and long wait times. The shortage may be due to a significant allocation of Blackwell GPUs for high-performance AI applications, potentially impacting the availability and price of current-generation GPUs. While NVIDIA anticipates supply constraints, they expect production to ramp up in early 2025, which could stabilize prices. Gamers are advised to consider purchasing GPUs now while prices are reasonable, as the holiday season may further strain supply and increase costs. Those with 30-series GPUs, particularly the Ti versions, may not need to upgrade immediately, as these models still perform well with current games.",

        "content": "Nvidia’s next-generation GPUs are expected to launch within the coming weeks, with many expecting the leather-clad CEO to announce the RTX 5090 and 5080 graphics cards during his keynote in CES 2025. According to Benchlife.info (machine translated), the RTX 5090, 5090D, 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 will be released during the first quarter of the coming year, with the 5060 Ti and 5060 expected to arrive shortly thereafter.\n\nMany expect that Huang will launch the 5090 and 5080 GPUs during CES 2025, especially as cooling components for AIB partners are already starting to ship from suppliers like Auras. On the other hand, rumors point to a February launch for the 5070 and 5070 Ti, but we’ll have to wait until April before we can get the 5060 and 5060 Ti. There is no news, though, of an RTX 5050 desktop GPU in recent leaks, although a Seasonic leak showed that it could potentially have a 100-watt TDP.\n\nIf we look at historical data, we can say that the launch of Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs is already delayed, especially as the company usually releases the first tranche of their next-generation graphics card every September. For example, the RTX 2080 launched in September 2018, while the RTX 3080 and 3090 arrived in September 2020. The RTX 4090 and 4080 were also announced in September 2022, although they arrived on store shelves in October and November of that year, respectively. The delay seems to have been caused by a chip design flaw, which took a few months to fix. The company said that the problem was “100% Nvidia’s fault” and that it has since fixed the problem, with production of Blackwell chips now resuming.\n\nWith the launch of the RTX 50-series getting closer each day, we also now get more details about these cards. For example, the RTX 5070 Ti is said to have 8,960 CUDA Cores with a 300-watt power draw, while the RTX 5080 would have 10,752 CUDA Cores and a 400-watt TPG. It’s also rumored that the RTX 5090 will require 600 watts of power and 21,760 cores, making it seem like a dual-core version of the 5080. However, these are all just rumors, and we’ll have to wait until CES 2025 to confirm the actual specifications that these graphics cards will have.",
        "summary": "Nvidia is expected to launch its next-generation GPUs, including the RTX 5090 and 5080, during CES 2025, with additional models like the 5070 Ti and 5070 following in February, and the 5060 Ti and 5060 in April. The release of these GPUs has been delayed from Nvidia's usual September schedule due to a chip design flaw, which the company has since resolved. Rumors suggest that the RTX 5090 will have 21,760 CUDA cores and require 600 watts of power, while the RTX 5080 and 5070 Ti will have 10,752 and 8,960 CUDA cores, respectively. Cooling components for these GPUs are already being shipped to AIB partners, indicating that the launch is imminent. Despite the leaks and rumors, the exact specifications will be confirmed during the CES 2025 keynote.",

How many remains to be seen, but here's the alleged release schedule:It's worth noting that the lowest tier 5060s will probably arrive later than the rest. Perhaps NVIDIA wants to stagger the budget model away from the proper money-makers? Rumors expect the 5060 to launch sometime in April, but of course that could change.The site also confirms early reports that the GB203-backed 5070 Ti will draw 300 watts and sport 8,960 CUDA cores. Even the (still pretty awesome) 4070 Ti gets around with 7,680 cores, which means the new card could be quite a handful, in a good way.The previously rumored 5080D variant is also missing from this list. The last generation 4090D was a China-only product with fewer cores and a lower power draw made for the sole purpose of circumventing China export regulations. Does this mean that even the 5080D doesn't meet the restrictions now?So far, further leaks have stated that the Blackwell architecture GPU of the RTX 50-series will support DDR7 memory and adopt the PCIe 5.0 specification. Here's the breakdown by model:While pricing info is still up in the air , you can be sure that the new cards will be no chump change. Thus, it now begs the question: should you wait till next year to buy one of these new beast-mode cards or do you try your chance at scoring a good RTX 40-series device this holiday season.",

        "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/upcoming-nvidia-rtx-5070-gpu-rumoured-to-have-fewer-cuda-cores-than-the-rtx-4070-super/",

        "content": "Hot on the heels of details of the supposed RTX 5070 Ti GPU come details of the next rung down in the rumoured Nvidia RTX 50 family of graphics cards. We give you the RTX 5070, the plain vanilla version and what could be a worryingly small step forward if this new \"leak\" is anything to go by.\n\nAccording to Benchlife (via Videocardz), we're looking at 6,400 CUDA cores for the RTX 5070. That's well down on the 8,960 rumoured for the RTX 5070 Ti. Perhaps even more pertinently, it's just 9% more CUDA cores than the existing RTX 4070 and, indeed, fewer CUDA cores than the RTX 4070 Super, which rocks 7,168.\n\nNow, there is more to GPU performance than mere core count. There's clock speed, which you might expect to be up at least a little bit thanks to the transition from TSMC's N5 silicon to a revised N4 node for the Blackwell architecture that will underpin all GPUs in the RTX 50 lineup.\n\nThat said, N4 is not a wholly new node compared to N5, more of an enhancement. Nvidia would have needed to make the jump to N3 for that. So, it may not be realistic to anticipate a huge jump in frequencies.\n\nThat said, the new 5070 is rumoured to be rated at a board power of 250 W, which is a fair old step up on the 200 W of the 4070. So, we'll wait to see about those clock speeds and cross our fingers and toes that they're up a decent chunk.\n\nThen there's architecture. It may turn out that the Blackwell in the RTX 5070 is much more efficient than the Ada Lovelace technology in the RTX 4070 and indeed 4070 Super. So, Blackwell may do more work per clock cycle. Features like the RT cores for ray tracing and the Tensor cores for AI stuff may get a particularly big boost. In other words, the RT 4070's CUDA cores and broader per-unit performance probably won't be perfectly comparable with those of the RTX 4070 and 4070 Super.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Nvidia RTX 50 Series rumoured specifications Header Cell - Column 0 RTX 5090 RTX 5080 RTX 5070 Ti RTX 5070 CUDA cores 21,760 10,752 8,960 6,400 Memory bus width 512-bit 256-bit 256-bit 192-bit Board power 600 W 400 W 300 W 250 W\n\nEven so, if all these rumours are correct, the gap between the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti in terms of CUDA core count is 40%, whereas the same metric for the RTX 4070 and 4070 Ti is just 30%. Go back to the RTX 3070 versus the RTX 3070 Ti and the gap was just 4%. Now it's supposedly going to be 40%. That only adds to the impression of a distinctly weak 70-series board this time around.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

As we reported earlier today, the latest rumours suggest that Intel's top Battlemage GPU for its second generation of Arc gaming graphics cards is aimed at RTX 4070 Super performance.\n\nIf it achieves that, it might just be as fast or maybe even faster than the RTX 5070. Put another way, Nvidia's failure to move the game on at the '70 level could make for a much more competitive mid-range GPU market this time.\n\nAMD is likewise putting all its effort into mid-range focused GPUs for its next-gen RDNA 4 GPUs. So, there's a chance of a price war in the mid-range come the new year. OK, it's just a whisker of a chance. But a chance nonetheless.",
        "summary": "The RTX 5070, part of Nvidia's rumored RTX 50 series, is expected to have 6,400 CUDA cores, which is significantly fewer than the 8,960 cores in the RTX 5070 Ti and only 9% more than the current RTX 4070. Despite the core count, the transition to a revised N4 node for the Blackwell architecture might offer some performance improvements, though not as significant as a jump to N3 would have provided. The RTX 5070 is rumored to have a board power of 250 W, higher than the 4070's 200 W, suggesting potential increases in clock speeds. The Blackwell architecture could be more efficient than the Ada Lovelace technology, potentially enhancing performance per clock cycle and improving features like ray tracing and AI processing. This situation might allow Intel and AMD to be more competitive in the mid-range GPU market, possibly leading to a price war in the coming year.",

        "content": "Nvidia comes through again, as AI dominates Microsoft Ignite and SC24\nThe king of artificial intelligence came through.\nDespite sky-high expectations, Nvidia Wednesday managed to outdo earnings expectations as it nearly doubled revenue from a year ago and more than doubled its profit. Investors more or less liked what CEO Jensen Huang (pictured) told them about the future too, as they bid up the stock almost a point on confidence that its new Blackwell graphics processing unit is poised for takeoff after months of delays and worries about their overheating in data centers. AI also boosted the fortunes of big-data giant Snowflake, whose earnings beat and new deal with Anthropic sent its stock up almost 33% Thursday.\nAI dominated two major conference this week, too. At its Ignite conference, Microsoft was only too happy to ride the AI train, taking Copilots into every nook and cranny of the enterprise. At the SC24 supercomputing conference, it was all about AI as well, because of course it is, since AI sucks up all available computing power.\nIn other AI news, Amazon announced it will invest another $4 billion in Anthropic, which will make Amazon Web Services its primary AI training partner, and it’s already working with Amazon’s chip design unit Annapurna Labs on new Trainium AI chips.\nThe Justice Department asked federal judge to order that Google sell its Chrome browser. If it happens, that will be a very big deal, but at best it will take years in court, and even then, who’s going to buy it and what will they do with it that will change the search market, which is the issue? Far from clear.\nCloudbrink, a company you probably haven’t heard of, tried to bury our story a year ago on a lawsuit filed by a co-founder against the company that charged financial fraud, hiring a firm to clean up its online image and make it look like our story was plagiarizing another story. Not so, of course, and we sent writer Mark Albertson to take a deep dive into the secretive field of reputation management — and got Google to rescind a DMCA takedown of the original story. Check out what he found.\nIn the never-ending quest to become one of the few dominant cybersecurity platforms, Wiz this week acquired Dazz for $450 million. And it’s not alone, as Palo Alto Networks continues to push “platformization” and Cyera this week netted $300 million more in funding to try to be a “consolidator of data security.”\nNext week, earnings will be up from Zoom, Dell, HP, Nutanix, Workday, CrowdStrike, Autodesk and PagerDuty. And just around the corner is AWS re:Invent, the big annual conference in Las Vegas, Dec. 2-6, when we’ll have all hands on deck for all the news, interviews and analysis.\nThis and other news were topics of discussion by Dave Vellante and John Furrier in theCUBE Pod, already out this week in an early edition on YouTube. And look for Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, early next week.\nHere are this week’s top news and analysis from SiliconANGLE and beyond:\nAI and data: AI gets lit at Microsoft Ignite\nTop news and analysis\nNvidia posts another strong earnings beat as customers race to deploy next-gen Blackwell GPUs It doesn’t look like its dominance in AI is threatened a bit for the next few years, perhaps many years if it continues to execute.\nSnowflake’s shares surge higher on blowout earnings, a promising acquisition and new AI partnership\nAmazon to invest another $4B in Anthropic as part of AI, chip collaboration\nElon Musk’s xAI raises $5B at $50B valuation (per the WSJ)\nNvidia’s upcoming Blackwell GPUs overheat in server racks, worrying customers, reports say\nAnd it was all about AI at Microsoft Ignite, no surprise:\nCopilots will be everywhere in Microsoft Ignite announcement spree\nMicrosoft’s Azure AI Foundry unifies AI development so everyone can get involved\nMicrosoft brings developers new tools for AI models and agents at Ignite 2024\nMicrosoft cranks up its AI infrastructure offerings with new VMs, cooling and power delivery tech\nMicrosoft expands Windows security and announces new proactive defense measures at Ignite 2024\nMicrosoft partners with Atom Computing to launch commercial quantum computer\nOracle expands integration with Microsoft Azure infrastructure\nInformatica expands support for AI and Microsoft Fabric on Azure\nSnowflake to broaden interoperability with Microsoft Dataverse and Dynamics\nDell boosts Azure AI storage and adds services to support Copilot+ PCs\nMongoDB and Microsoft expand partnership to advance AI applications and data analytics\nNew models and services\nAWS App Studio launches in general availability, making everyone an app builder\nGoogle Cloud introduces AI agent ecosystem program\nCerebras Systems upgrades its inference service with record performance for Meta’s largest LLM model\nNew updates give Mistral AI’s Le Chat an edge over ChatGPT\nChinese AI startup DeepSeek’s newest model surpasses OpenAI’s o1 in ‘reasoning’ tasks\nZilliz debuts new release of its cloud-based vector database\nMitel brings AI to its multicloud contact experience offering\nStarTree brings batch-like flexibility and performance to streaming data\nProcore to add AI agents to its construction management software platform\nDeloitte Digital unveils Agentforce accelerators with Salesforce and Anthropic for trustworthy LLM use cases in regulated industries\nQuantization, a widely used technique to make AI models more efficient, has limits — and the industry could be fast approaching them (per TechCrunch)\nMoney matters\nDatabricks is reportedly now looking to raise up to $8 billion to cash out employees.

And just Thursday came a report that OpenAI may do its own browser. Much of the big-tech antitrust action seems so performative, despite real concerns that might be better addressed than through yearslong battles. Not to mention, I’ve always thought that defining the search market as, well, mostly Google search, is misleading; why not include searches on Amazon and other sites? If I’m searching for a product, that’s where I go first, not Google, and I’m not alone. A restaurant?

The next-gen GPU is expected to supersede Nvidia's current RTX 4090 as the best graphics card for gaming and indeed the best graphics card full stop.\n\nOther the question of performance, the one thing we're all wondering about is naturally the cost. The latest rumour is that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 price may be lower than we initially expected, although it will still be eye-wateringly expensive.\n\nthe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is currently the top-of-the-range graphics card (Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is rumoured to have 680 tensor cores, 32 GB of GDDR7 memory (up from 24GB in the 4090) and a base frequency of 2,235 MHz. The new Blackwell architecture means the GPU is set to be driven by AI, with DLSS and Frame Generation expected to play a bigger part.\n\nIt was previously rumored that the base price would be $2,000 or even $2,500. That would be a rise from the already very expensive RTX 4090, which now starts at $1,599 (although it more often costs around $1,800 when packed by the likes of Asus or Gigabyte).\n\nBits And Chips now claims that the price will be around €1,800 ($1,890) for the base configuration of the GPU. That's according to \"several Chinese and Japanese journalists.\" It's not a difference that's likely to change your mind about whether you can afford it, but it seems very reasonable if it does pack the specs we're expecting, and it may sway your decision about whether to wait for it.\n\nAlso, if the 5090 does launch at a price that's more similar to that of the 4090, there's more of a chance that we'll see bigger discounts come up on the current top-of-the-range GPU, which has proved to be stubbornly resistant to deals so far (see the best current graphics card deals below). Note that there's no official confirmation from Nvidia on any RTX 5000 GPU nor specifications or pricing.",

The servers and workstations are aimed at a variety of applications, including AI, virtual desktop infrastructure, professional visualization software, and high-performance computing.\n\n\"Comino is excited to open pre-orders for our next-generation liquid-cooled workstations and servers featuring the Nvidia RTX 5090 GPUs,\" a statement by Comino reads. \"Designed for top performance, these systems are trusted by leading companies and reviewers. Built to thrive in harsh environments of up to 40°C, they deliver 100% performance and beyond, 24/7.\"\n\nFor now, Comino offers to fill in the form to get additional information about its Grando Server with eight Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics cards, so we don't know the pricing yet. The estimated time of availability will be provided upon the description of a project that the machine will be used for, though you should probably expect the server to be available in 2025. The price of the machines is unknown at this time.\n\nAs Nvidia has not formally introduced its GeForce RTX 5090 based on the GB202 processor, it is hard to say when exactly this graphics card will hit the market and how much it will cost. It's logical to assume that Comino is already taking pre-orders on its servers because it received key specs and schematics of the graphics card from Nvidia and has already developed its waterblock and liquid-cooled solutions for this board.\n\nComino notes that the availability of its GeForce RTX 5090-based machines will be limited (at least initially due to high demand), so it suggests that interested parties should 'secure their spot.'\n\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 5090, the flagship Blackwell GPU for desktops, is rumored to feature the GB202 graphics processor with 21,760 CUDA cores and 32GB of GDDR7 memory on a 512-bit interface. This powerhouse could draw up to 600W of power, according to leaks. Even if the final specs are slightly toned down, it is poised to be one of the best graphics cards upon its release.\n\nThe main intrigue about the release is whether Nvidia will launch the new flagship product for gamers by the holiday season or postpone it till January and formally introduce its GeForce RTX 5090 at CES.",

        "content": "According to a new leak from Benchlife, Nvidia may launch the vast majority of the RTX 50-series in the first quarter of 2025 — but one GPU is notably missing from the early lineup. That could be very good news for AMD and Intel. While Nvidia will rule the high-end market, the other two brands may get to swoop in with some of the best graphics cards for gamers on a budget and get some breathing room before Nvidia strikes back.\n\nBenchlife reveals that we’ll see many of the RTX 50-series staples arrive in the first quarter of the year. The flagship RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080 arriving in January feel like a sure thing at this point, but many leakers also suggest that we’ll see other GPUs make their debut during CES 2025.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 are all said to be launching in the first quarter of the year. The RTX 5090D is also said to be coming around that time, and it’s likely to be a cutdown version of the RTX 5090 made to be exported to China. There’s no mention of the RTX 5080D, though. That implies the base RTX 5080 may have specs and performance that already make the cutoff.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nBenchlife also revealed a bit more of the specs for the upcoming GPUs. We heard about the RTX 5070 Ti yesterday, which is said to feature 8,960 CUDA cores. Benchlife now adds that it’ll also have 16GB of GDDR7 memory. Meanwhile, the RTX 5070 is said to sport 6,400 CUDA cores, a 250-watt thermal design power (TDP), and 12GB of GDDR7 memory. The signs are all there pointing toward Nvidia keeping the RTX 5060 with just 8GB of VRAM, but of course, all of this is just speculation at this point.\n\nWith four GPUs hitting the shelves in the first quarter, Nvidia will have pretty good coverage of the market, from the high-end to the mainstream. However, the lack of news about the RTX 5060 Ti and the RTX 5060 is interesting. Could it be that Nvidia is taking its time with releasing its most popular GPUs?\n\nThat kind of adds up. Recent leaks revealed that Nvidia is reportedly ending production for just about every RTX 40-series GPU apart from the RTX 4060, and if the 5060 is not expected to arrive until later, that might be why Nvidia continues making new RTX 4060s.\n\nAssuming all of the above checks out, Intel and AMD will have a unique opportunity to strike at the budget side of the market without much next-gen competition from Nvidia. Both manufacturers are said to be aiming for the mainstream market, with AMD’s flagship unlikely to be able to rival anything above an RTX 5070 Ti. As such, having less competition with a delayed RTX 5060 is good news all around for AMD and Intel.\n\nIt won’t be long before we know more. Nvidia is rumored to announce the RTX 50-series at CES 2025 in January, and AMD is set to do the same with RDNA 4. Intel may strike first, with Battlemage possibly arriving in December.",

However, the absence of the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti from the early lineup could benefit AMD and Intel, allowing them to target the budget market without immediate competition from Nvidia. The leak also provides some specifications for the upcoming GPUs, such as the RTX 5070 Ti featuring 8,960 CUDA cores and 16GB of GDDR7 memory. Nvidia's decision to continue producing the RTX 4060 while delaying the RTX 5060 may give AMD and Intel a chance to capture the mainstream market. Nvidia is expected to announce the RTX 50-series at CES 2025, while AMD and Intel are also preparing to launch their next-gen products around the same time.",

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%.\n\nThe major gauges closed out the week with wins of over 1%, despite getting off to a lackluster start as the post-election rally stalled.\n\nMarkets regrouped after Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings fell short of definitively settling the question of whether AI would keep boosting stocks. Some of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech megacap stocks closed lower on Friday, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), dogged by the potential forced sale of Google Chrome.\n\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY), Industrials (XLI), and Financials (XLF) led the sector gains this week, with XLF closing at an all-time high.\n\n• USD (^GSPC) View Quote Details\n\nWall Street is still waiting to learn whom Trump will tap for his Treasury secretary — an announcement that could sway markets, given its importance to the economy. The president-elect tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be the US attorney general after his prior pick, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, surging bitcoin continued to move near the landmark $100,000 level, buoyed by growing confidence that the Trump administration will support pro-crypto policies. The leading token broke above $99,500 early on Friday before retreating amid hopes for looser regulatory oversight after SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he will step down soon. Smaller cryptocurrencies also got a boost.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER\n\n16 updates",

We cannot depend on other countries' AI,\" he said.\n\nAmirudin said that this initiative aims to ensure Selangor has the ability to manage its own data and identification using technology that is not influenced by the perspective of a specific country.\n\nMeanwhile, he also said that Selangor always strives to increase state revenue by introducing various new policies and formulas to ensure a sustainable income.\n\nHe said his administration does not rely on land revenue and contributions from the federal government to increase state revenue, as claimed. Income is also generated from other sources, such as state-owned enterprises.\n\nHe said state-owned enterprises' contributions to Selangor's coffers have reached RM30mil, with an additional RM10mil expected before the end of this year.\n\n\"Previously, we have never received (revenue) from the Selangor Utility Corridor (Kusel), but this year, Kusel will contribute RM1mil for the first time after we allowed 'underneath' matters following classification and licensing.\n\n\"We also received revenue from the Zero Discharge Policy (ZDP). We estimate up to RM121mil in total if we can achieve it. We have already received RM18mil this year and will get more... our first collection in Nov 2024 will reach RM1mil,\" he said. – Bernama",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 14 AI News Updates Wall Street Is Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring.\n\nMerely days after Donald Trump won a tightly-contested election for the top office in the US, Elon Musk, one of his most prominent backers, received further good news as xAI, the AI startup he founded in 2023, raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. News publication The Wall Street Journal reported that Valor Equity Partners, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz were part of the raise, while the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar also participated in the funding process. This set of investors had also backed the startup with $6 billion in funding earlier this year.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nxAI has developed Grok, one of the leading AI chatbots in the world. It rivals the performance of chatbots from tech powerhouses with far greater resources. The firm also controls Colossus, one of the most powerful supercomputers globally. The supercomputer will become fully operational by the end of this year and Musk plans on expanding the hardware at the center of this endeavor to 200,000 GPUs. Last year, the startup also released PromptIDE, an integrated development environment designed for prompt engineering and interpretability research.\n\nREAD ALSO: 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Maintains Strong AI Demand: Loop Capital's Bullish Outlook\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 20, Loop Capital maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $175 price. In an investor note, the advisory noted that there has been increased noise throughout the Gen AI ecosystem of late, but analysis suggests that Nvidia’s anticipated demand trajectory remains intact. The note further detailed that GB200 NVL72 at material volume was really a July-September 2025 event, but it may not matter much as the amount of increased Hopper production may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out.\n\nStory Continues",

        "content": "Get ready for yet another GPU shortage, as Nvidia has warned about potential shortages in the current quarter. Although the company’s third-quarter revenue saw a healthy growth, in its recent earnings call, company Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that the fourth-quarter revenue is expected to decline sequentially due to supply constraints.\n\nThe anticipated GPU shortage could potentially stem from a strategic shift in production to prepare for the next-generation RTX 50-series “Blackwell” GPUs, slated for release in 2025. This supply transition, coupled with surging gaming and professional use-case demand, seems to have left the company in a tight spot. Nvidia acknowledged its struggle to maintain stock for both gamers and enterprise customers, emphasizing its ongoing efforts to expand manufacturing capacity.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nFor gamers, this warning means longer wait times and potential price surges for Nvidia’s GPUs during the holiday season. Retailers may face limited inventory of RTX 40-series models, especially premium cards like the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090. This challenge arrives as gamers increasingly seek powerful hardware for 4K gaming and emerging AI-enhanced features, making GPU availability crucial.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nNvidia remains optimistic about a recovery though, projecting improved supply by early 2025 as production ramps up. Analysts note that the company’s dual strategy — balancing gaming and enterprise segments — has proven profitable but may exacerbate short-term shortages. Additionally, the ramp-up to the RTX 50-series could generate renewed interest among gamers, potentially easing pressure on older product lines.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nvidia continues to solidify its leadership in both gaming and AI markets. The company’s GPUs remain a cornerstone of the gaming ecosystem and the driving force behind advancements in generative AI technologies. However, gamers should brace for a challenging quarter in obtaining sought-after GPUs until supply levels stabilize.\n\nOn the positive side, Nvidia’s third-quarter revenue surged 94% year-over-year to $35 billion, with net income rising 109% to $19.3 billion. The data center segment drove this growth, contributing $30.7 billion (87.7% of total revenue), fueled by strong demand for H100/H200 and upcoming Blackwell GPUs.",

        "content": "AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) help organizations streamline and reduce manual workloads. These agents use multilevel, iterative reasoning to analyze problems, devise solutions, and execute tasks with various tools. Unlike traditional chatbots, LLM-powered agents automate complex tasks by effectively understanding and processing information. To avoid potential risks in specific applications, maintaining human oversight remains essential when working with autonomous AI agents.\n\nIn this post, you’ll learn how to build a human-in-the-loop AI agent using NVIDIA NIM microservices, an accelerated API optimized for AI inference. The post features a social media use case to showcase how these versatile AI agents can handle complex tasks with ease. With NIM microservices, you can seamlessly integrate advanced LLMs into your workflows, providing the scalability and flexibility required for AI-driven tasks. Whether you‘re creating promotional content or automating complex workflows, this tutorial is designed to accelerate your processes.\n\nTo see a demo, watch How to Build a Simple AI Agent in 5 Minutes with NVIDIA NIM.\n\nBuilding an AI agent for personalized social media content\n\nOne of the biggest challenges marketers face today is generating high-quality, creative promotional content across platforms. The goal is to create varied promotional messages and artwork that can be published on social media.\n\nTraditionally, a project leader assigns these tasks to specialists like content writers and digital artists. But what if AI agents could help make this process more efficient?\n\nThis use case involves two AI agents—the Content Creator Agent and the Digital Artist Agent. These AI agents will generate promotional content and submit it to a human decision-maker for final approval, ensuring that human control remains central to the creative process.\n\nVideo 1. Watch how a marketer creates a social media post with the support of AI agents\n\nArchitecting the human-agent decision-making workflow\n\nBuilding this human-in-the-loop system involves creating a cognitive workflow where AI agents assist in specific tasks, while humans perform the final decision-making. Figure 1 outlines the interaction between the human decision-maker and the agents.\n\nFigure 1. Human-agent interaction conceptual architecture\n\nThe Content Creator Agent uses the Llama 3.1 405B model, accelerated by NVIDIA LLM NIM microservices. LangChain ChatNVIDIA with NIM functional calling and structured output are also integrated to ensure organized, reliable results. ChatNVIDIA is an-open-source Python library contributed by NVIDIA to LangChain that enables developers to easily connect with NVIDIA NIM. These combined capabilities are consolidated into LangChain runnable chain (LCEL) expressions, creating a robust agent workflow.\n\nConstructing the Content Creator Agent\n\nBegin by constructing the Content Creator Agent. This agent generates promotional messages following specific formatting guidelines, using the NVIDIA API catalog preview API endpoints. NVIDIA AI Enterprise customers can also download and run NIM endpoints locally.\n\nUse the Python code below to get started:\n\nfrom langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints import ChatNVIDIA from langchain import prompts, chat_models, hub from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field, validator from typing import Optional, List ## 1. construct the system prompt --------- prompt_template = \"\"\" ### [INST] You are an expert social media content creator. Your task is to create a different promotion message with the following Product Description : ------ {product_desc} ------ The output promotion message MUST use the following format : ''' Title: a powerful, short message that dipict what this product is about Message: be creative for the promotion message, but make it short and ready for social media feeds. Tags: the hash tag human will nomally use in social media ''' Begin! [/INST] \"\"\" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=['produce_desc'], template=prompt_template, ) ## 2. provide seeded product_desc text product_desc=\"Explore the latest community-built AI models with an API optimized and accelerated by NVIDIA, then deploy anywhere with NVIDIA NIM™ inference microservices.\" ## 3. structural output using LMFE class StructureOutput(BaseModel): Title: str = Field(description=\"Title of the promotion message\") Message : str = Field(description=\"The actual promotion message\") Tags: List[str] = Field(description=\"Hashtags for social media, usually starts with #\") ## 4. A powerful LLM llm_with_output_structure=ChatNVIDIA(model=\"meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct\").with_structured_output(StructureOutput) ## construct the content_creator agent content_creator = ( prompt | llm_with_output_structure ) out=content_creator.invoke({\"product_desc\":product_desc})\n\nUsing the digital artist agent\n\nNext, we introduce the Digital Artist Agent, which transforms promotional text into creative visuals using the NVIDIA sdXL-turbo text-to-image model. This agent rewrites input queries and generates high-quality images designed for social media promotion campaigns. The following code provides an example of how the agent integrates:\n\nimport requests import base64, io from PIL import Image import requests, json def generate_image(prompt :str) -> str : \"\"\" generate image from text Args: prompt: input text \"\"\" ## re-writing the input promotion title in to appropriate image_gen prompt gen_prompt=llm_rewrite_to_image_prompts(prompt) print(\"start generating image with llm re-write prompt:\", gen_prompt) invoke_url = \"https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/genai/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo\" headers = { \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {nvapi_key}\", \"Accept\": \"application/json\", } payload = { \"text_prompts\": [{\"text\": gen_prompt}], \"seed\": 0, \"sampler\": \"K_EULER_ANCESTRAL\", \"steps\": 2 } response = requests.post(invoke_url, headers=headers, json=payload) response.raise_for_status() response_body = response.json() ## load back to numpy array print(response_body['artifacts'][0].keys()) imgdata = base64.b64decode(response_body[\"artifacts\"][0][\"base64\"]) filename = 'output.jpg' with open(filename, 'wb') as f: f.write(imgdata) im = Image.open(filename) img_location=f\"the output of the generated image will be stored in this path : {filename}\" return img_location\n\nUse the following Python script to rewrite user input queries into image generation prompts:\n\nfrom langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints import ChatNVIDIA from langchain import prompts, chat_models, hub from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate def llm_rewrite_to_image_prompts(user_query): prompt = prompts.ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( \"system\", \"Summarize the following user query into a very short, one-sentence theme for image generation, MUST follow this format : A iconic, futuristic image of , no text, no amputation, no face, bright, vibrant\", ), (\"user\", \"{input}\"), ] ) model = ChatNVIDIA(model=\"mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1\") chain = ( prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ) out= chain.invoke({\"input\":user_query}) #print(type(out)) return out}\n\nNext, bind the image generation into the selected LLM and wrap it in LCEL to create the Digital Artist Agent:\n\n## bind image generation as tool into llama3.1-405b llm llm=ChatNVIDIA(model=\"meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct\") llm_with_img_gen_tool=llm.bind_tools([generate_image],tool_choice=\"generate_image\") ## use LCEL to construct Digital Artist Agent digital_artist = ( llm_with_img_gen_tool | output_to_invoke_tools )\n\nIntegrating human-in-the-loop with the role of the decision-maker\n\nTo maintain human oversight, the agents will share their outputs for final approval. A human decision-maker will review both the text generated by the Content Creator Agent and the artwork produced by the Digital Artist Agent.\n\nThis interaction allows for multiple iterations, ensuring that both the promotional messages and images are polished and ready for deployment.\n\nThe agentic logic places humans at the center as decision-makers, assigning the appropriate agents for each task. LangGraph is used to orchestrate the agentic cognitive architecture.\n\nThis involves a function that asks for human input:\n\n# Or you can directly instantiate the tool from langchain_community.tools import HumanInputRun from langchain.agents import AgentType, load_tools from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools def get_human_input() -> str: \"\"\" Put human as decision maker, human will decide which agent is best for the task\"\"\" print(\"You have been given 2 agents. Please select exactly _ONE_ agent to help you with the task, enter 'y' to confirm your choice.\") print(\"\"\"Available agents are :\n\n1 ContentCreator\n\n2 DigitalArtist\n\nEnter 1 or 2\"\"\") contents = [] while True: try: line = input() if line=='1': tool=\"ContentCreator\" line=tool elif line=='2': tool=\"DigitalArtist\" line=tool else: pass except EOFError: break if line == \"y\": print(f\"tool selected : {tool} \") break contents.append(line) return \"\n\n\".join(contents) # You can modify the tool when loading ask_human = HumanInputRun(input_func=get_human_input)\n\nNext, create two additional Python functions to serve as graph nodes, which LangGraph uses to represent steps or actions within a workflow. These nodes enable the agent to execute specific tasks sequentially or in parallel, creating a flexible and structured process:\n\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolInvocation from colorama import Fore,Style # Define the functions needed def human_assign_to_agent(state): # ensure using original prompt inputs = state[\"input\"] input_to_agent = state[\"input_to_agent\"] concatenate_str = Fore.BLUE+inputs+ ' : '+Fore.CYAN+input_to_agent + Fore.RESET print(concatenate_str) print(\"---\"*10) agent_choice=ask_human.invoke(concatenate_str) print(Fore.CYAN+ \"choosen_agent : \" + agent_choice + Fore.RESET) return {\"agent_choice\": agent_choice } def agent_execute_task(state): inputs= state[\"input\"] input_to_agent = state[\"input_to_agent\"] print(Fore.CYAN+input_to_agent + Fore.RESET) # choosen agent will execute the task choosen_agent = state['agent_choice'] if choosen_agent=='ContentCreator': structured_respond=content_creator.invoke({\"product_desc\":input_to_agent}) respond='\n\n'.join([structured_respond.Title,structured_respond.Message,''.join(structured_respond.Tags)]) elif choosen_agent==\"DigitalArtist\": respond=digital_artist.invoke(input_to_agent) else: respond=\"please reselect the agent, there are only 2 agents available: 1.ContentCreator or 2.DigitalArtist\" print(Fore.CYAN+ \"agent_output:\n\n\" + respond + Fore.RESET) return {\"agent_use_tool_respond\": respond}\n\nFinally, bring everything together by connecting the nodes and edges to form the human-in-the-loop multi-agent workflow. Once the graph is compiled, you’re ready to proceed:\n\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph # Define a new graph workflow = StateGraph(State) # Define the two nodes workflow.add_node(\"start\", human_assign_to_agent) workflow.add_node(\"end\", agent_execute_task) # This means that this node is the first one called workflow.set_entry_point(\"start\") workflow.add_edge(\"start\", \"end\") workflow.add_edge(\"end\", END) # Finally, we compile it! # This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable, # meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable app = workflow.compile()\n\nLaunching the human-agent workflow\n\nNow, launch the app. It prompts you to assign one of the available agents for the given task.\n\nA prompt for writing the promotional text\n\nFirst, query the Content Creator Agent to write promotion text, including a title, message, and social media hashtags (Figure 2). Repeat this until satisfied with the output.\n\nFigure 2. A human queries the Content Creator Agent to generate social media promotion text\n\nA Python code sample:\n\nmy_query=\"create a good promotional message for social promotion events using the following inputs\" product_desc=\"NVIDIA NIM microservices power GenAI workflow\" respond=app.invoke({\"input\":my_query, \"input_to_agent\":product_desc})\n\nThe human selects 1 = Content Creator Agent for the task. The agent executes and returns the agent_output , as shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Sample output from invoking Content Creator Agent pipeline\n\nA prompt for creating illustrations\n\nOnce satisfied with the results, move on to query the Digital Artist Agent to create artwork for social media promotion (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4. Human assigns Digital Artist Agent to generate social media artwork\n\nThe following Python code sample uses the title generated by the Content Creator Agent as input for the image prompt:\n\n## taken the output from the Title from the output of Content Creator Agent prompt_for_image=respond['agent_use_tool_respond'].split('\n\n')[0].split(':')[-1].strip() ## Human decision maker give instruction to the agent workflow app input_query=\"generate an image for me from the below promotion message\" respond2=app.invoke({\"input\":input_query, \"input_to_agent\":prompt_for_image})\n\nThe generated image is saved as output.jpg.\n\nFigure 5. Sample output from invoking Digital Artist Agent pipeline\n\nIterating for high-quality results\n\nYou can iterate on the generated images to obtain different variations of artworks to get the results you’re looking for (Figure 6). Adjusting the input prompt slightly from the Content Creator Agent can yield diverse images from the Digital Artist Agent.\n\nFigure 6. Sample images generated by the Digital Artist Agent\n\nRefining the final product\n\nFinally, perform post-processing and refine the combined outputs from both agents, formatting them in markdown for final visual review (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7. Post-processed output of a social media post and accompanying image produced by AI agents and approved by a human\n\nIn this blog post, you’ve learned how to build a human-in-the-loop AI agent using NVIDIA NIM microservices and LangGraph by LangChain to streamline content creation workflows.

        "content": "For organizations adapting AI foundation models with domain-specific data, the ability to rapidly create and deploy fine-tuned models is key to efficiently delivering value with enterprise generative AI applications.\n\nNVIDIA NIM offers prebuilt, performance-optimized inference microservices for the latest AI foundation models, including seamless deployment of models customized using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).\n\nIn some cases, it’s ideal to use methods like continual pretraining, DPO, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), or model merging, where the underlying model weights are adjusted directly in the training or customization process, unlike PEFT with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). In these cases, inference software configuration for the model must be updated for optimal performance given the new weights.\n\nRather than burden you with this often lengthy process, NIM can automatically build a TensorRT-LLM inference engine performance optimized for the adjusted model and GPUs in your local environment, and then load it for running inference as part of a single-step model deployment process.\n\nIn this post, we explore how to rapidly deploy NIM microservices for models that have been customized through SFT by using locally built, performance-optimized TensorRT-LLM inference engines. We include all the necessary commands as well as some helpful options, so you can try it out on your own today.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo run this tutorial, you need an NVIDIA-accelerated compute environment with access to 80 GB of GPU memory and which has git-lfs installed.\n\nBefore you can pull and deploy a NIM microservice in an NVIDIA-accelerated compute environment, you also need an NGC API key.\n\nNavigate to the Meta Llama 3 8B Instruct model listing in the NVIDIA API Catalog. Choose Login at the top right and follow the instructions. When you’re logged in, choose Build with this NIM on the model page. Choose Self-Hosted API and follow either option to access NIM microservices access: NVIDIA Developer Program membership with free access to NIM for research, development, and testing only.\n\nThe 90-day NVIDIA AI Enterprise license, which includes access to NVIDIA Enterprise Support.\n\nAfter you provide the necessary details for your selected access method, copy your NGC API key and be ready to move forward with NIM. For more information, see Launch NVIDIA NIM for LLMs.\n\nGetting started with NIM microservices\n\nProvide your NGC CLI API key as an environment variable in your compute environment:\n\nexport NGC_API_KEY=<<YOUR API KEY HERE>>\n\nYou also must point to, create, and modify permissions for a directory to be used as a cache during the optimization process:\n\nexport NIM_CACHE_PATH=/tmp/nim/.cache mkdir -p $NIM_CACHE_PATH chmod -R 777 $NIM_CACHE_PATH\n\nTo demonstrate locally built, optimized TensorRT-LLM inference engines for deploying fine-tuned models with NIM, you need a model that has undergone customization through SFT. For this tutorial, use the NVIDIA OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B model, which is a customization of Meta’s Llama-3.1-8B using the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset.\n\nThe base model must be available as a downloadable NIM for LLMs. For more information about downloadable NIM microservices, see the NIM Type: Run Anywhere filter in the NVIDIA API Catalog.\n\nAll you need is the weights to this model, which can be obtained in several ways. For this post, clone the model repository using the following commands:\n\ngit lfs install git clone https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF export MODEL_WEIGHT_PARENT_DIRECTORY=$PWD\n\nNow that you have the model weights collected, move on to the next step: firing up the microservice.\n\nSelecting from available performance profiles\n\nBased on your selected model and hardware configuration, the most applicable inference performance profile available is automatically selected. There are two available performance profiles for local inference engine generation:\n\nLatency: Focused on delivering a NIM microservice that is optimized for latency.\n\nFocused on delivering a NIM microservice that is optimized for latency. Throughput: Focused on delivering a NIM microservice that is optimized for batched throughput.\n\nFor more information about supported features, including available precision, see the Support Matrix topic in the NVIDIA NIM documentation.\n\nExample using an SFT model\n\nCreate a locally built TensorRT-LLM inference engine for OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B by running the following commands:\n\ndocker run -it --rm --gpus all \\ --user $(id -u):$(id -g)\\ --network=host \\ --shm-size=32GB \\ -e NGC_API_KEY \\ -e NIM_FT_MODEL=/opt/weights/hf/OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B \\ -e NIM_SERVED_MODEL_NAME=OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B \\ -v $NIM_CACHE_PATH:/opt/nim/.cache \\ -v $MODEL_WEIGHT_PARENT_DIRECTORY:/opt/weights/hf \\ nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama3_1-8b:1.3.0\n\nThe command is nearly identical to the typical command you’d use to deploy a NIM microservice. In this case, you’ve added the extra NIM_FT_MODEL parameter, which points to the OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B model.\n\nWith that, NIM builds an optimized inference engine locally. To perform inference using this new NIM microservice, run the following Python code example:\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI( base_url = \"http://localhost:8000/v1\", api_key = \"none\" ) completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B\", messages=[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"What is your name?\"}], temperature=0.2, top_p=0.7, max_tokens=100, stream=True ) for chunk in completion: if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None: print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end=\"\")\n\nVideo 1. How to Deploy Fine-Tuned AI Models\n\nBuilding an optimized TensorRT-LLM engine with a custom performance profile\n\nOn supported GPUs, you can use a similar command to spin up your NIM microservice. Follow the Model Profile instructions to launch your microservice and determine which profiles are accessible for it.\n\nexport IMG_NAME=\"nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:1.3.0\" docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus=all $IMG_NAME list-model-profiles \\ -e NGC_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY\n\nAssuming you’re on an H100 GPU, you should see the following profiles available:\n\ntensorrt_llm-h100-fp8-tp1-throughput\n\ntensorrt_llm-h100-fp8-tp2-latency\n\nRe-run the command and provide an additional environment variable to specify the desired profile:\n\ndocker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus=all $IMG_NAME list-model-profiles \\ -e NGC_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY \\ -e NIM_MODEL_PROFILE=tensorrt_llm-h100-fp8-tp2-latency\n\nNow that you’ve relaunched your NIM microservice with the desired profile, use Python to interact with the model:\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI( base_url = \"http://localhost:8000/v1\", api_key = \"none\" ) completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"llama-3.1-8b-instruct\", messages=[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"What is your name?\"}], temperature=0.2, top_p=0.7, max_tokens=100, stream=True ) for chunk in completion: if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None: print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end=\"\")\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether you’re using PEFT or SFT methods for model customization, NIM accelerates customized model deployment for high-performance inferencing in a few simple steps. With optimized TensorRT-LLM inference engines built automatically in your local environment, NIM is unlocking new possibilities for rapidly deploying accelerated AI inferencing anywhere.\n\nFor more information, see the following resources:\n\nTo engage with NVIDIA and the NIM microservices community, see the NVIDIA NIM developer forum.",

This optimization significantly frees up processing power, enabling additional tasks and improving the overall performance of applications using CSI cameras.\n\nFigure 2 shows the CPU performance improvement with the default Argus API implementation in JetPack 6.0 compared to the enhanced Argus API implementation in JetPack 6.1 for 12 CSI cameras used simultaneously. AR0234 and dual-IMX274–based cameras were used at 1920x1200p, 30 fps for verification.\n\nFigure 2. Camera stack in JetPack 6.1 CPU utilization\n\nThe enhanced camera stack also contains multiple stability and image quality improvements.\n\nIntroducing firmware-based Trusted Platform Module\n\nJetPack has consistently enhanced security offerings by integrating advanced features with each new release, ensuring robust protection across the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\n\nFoundational security features help provide a robust and comprehensive security framework for Jetson-based applications, protecting against a wide range of threats and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and protection of sensitive data. These features include the following:\n\nHardware root of trust (RoT)\n\nSecure boot\n\nTrusted execution environment\n\nDisk encryption\n\nMemory encryption\n\nRollback protection\n\nProtection from physical attacks\n\nJetPack 6.1 enhances the security capabilities of the JetPack platform by introducing firmware-based Trusted Platform Module (fTPM), a software-based implementation of the TPM standard.\n\nfTPM delivers multiple advantages, such as secure key management without the need for extra hardware, simplifying system design and reducing costs. It supports trusted boot and remote attestation, ensuring device integrity and defense against tampering. By securing cryptographic operations, fTPM strengthens data protection and enables secure communication.\n\nFor Jetson users, fTPM offers the following key benefits:\n\nStronger security: The fTPM feature significantly strengthens the security of cryptographic operations by creating a dedicated, isolated environment within the trusted execution environment (TEE). This ensures that sensitive processes, such as key generation and encryption, are safeguarded from external tampering or malicious software attacks.\n\nThe fTPM feature significantly strengthens the security of cryptographic operations by creating a dedicated, isolated environment within the trusted execution environment (TEE). This ensures that sensitive processes, such as key generation and encryption, are safeguarded from external tampering or malicious software attacks. Data protection: It securely stores critical information like cryptographic keys, digital certificates, and passwords, preventing unauthorized access. This ensures that sensitive data remains confidential and is only accessible to authorized components.\n\nIt securely stores critical information like cryptographic keys, digital certificates, and passwords, preventing unauthorized access.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. assured investors that its new product lineup will continue to fuel an artificial intelligence-driven growth run, while also signaling that the rush to get chips out the door is proving costlier than expected.\n\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\n\nSpeaking after the release of quarterly results, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said that Nvidia’s highly anticipated Blackwell products will ship this quarter amid “very strong” demand. But the production and engineering costs of the chips will weigh on profit margins, and Nvidia’s sales forecast for the current period didn’t match some of Wall Street’s more optimistic projections.\n\nThat brought a tepid reaction from investors, who had bid up Nvidia shares almost 200% this year heading into the earnings report. After that dizzying rally, which turned the chipmaker into the world’s most valuable company, anything but a blowout quarter was bound to be a disappointment.\n\nThe shares fell as much as 3.6% on Thursday before rebounding by the afternoon. They closed up 0.5% at $146.67.\n\nNvidia predicted fiscal fourth-quarter sales of about $37.5 billion. While the average analyst estimate was $37.1 billion, projections ranged as high as $41 billion.\n\n“The guidance seems to show lower growth, but this may be Nvidia being conservative,” said Alvin Nguyen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. “Short term, there is no worry about AI demand. Nvidia is doing everything they should be doing.”\n\nThe company’s biggest moneymaker is its accelerator chip, which helps develop artificial intelligence models by bombarding them with data. Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot debuted in 2022, a frenzy of AI services has created insatiable demand for the product.\n\nAll About Nvidia Chips, AI Hype and What Lies Ahead: QuickTake\n\nWall Street has been closely watching the launch of Blackwell, the latest entry in that category, which is faster and has an improved ability to link up with other semiconductors. Manufacturing challenges have slowed the rollout, and Nvidia warned again of supply constraints on Wednesday. Demand for the products is expected to exceed supply for several quarters.\n\n“Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.”\n\nHuang said that Blackwell is now in “full production,” and there’s still an appetite for Hopper, the previous design. “Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners,” he said during the conference call.\n\nBut the switch to Blackwell has taken a toll on profitability. The company’s gross margin, which measures the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will dip to as low as 73% this quarter from 75% in the previous period. The figure is expected to rebound when the new products reach larger-scale production, and the economics are more favorable.\n\nWhen asked whether Nvidia’s gross margin could be back in the mid-70s by the middle of next year, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that’s a reasonable assumption. Nvidia remains far above its peers in this category: Its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has a gross margin that’s 20 percentage points narrower. Intel Corp.’s isn’t even half of Nvidia’s total.\n\nNvidia’s growth over the past two years has been staggering. Its sales are poised to double for a second year in a row, and it now notches more money in profit than it used to generate in total revenue.\n\nNvidia’s revenue rose 94% to $35.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 27. Excluding certain items, profit was 81 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $33.25 billion and earnings of 74 cents a share.\n\nNvidia’s biggest division, the data center unit, saw revenue double from a year earlier to $30.8 billion. That beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nBut networking revenue within that unit declined sequentially, and the business is more dependent than ever on a small group of customers: cloud service providers. That cohort, which includes companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, accounted for 50% of data center revenue, up from 45% in the prior period.\n\nInvestors want that number to go down, to show that the use of AI is spreading across the economy.\n\nOther recent earnings reports have given strong signals for AI. Nvidia customers, including Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc., have reaffirmed their commitment to spend heavily on AI infrastructure.\n\nWATCH: Nvidia's Surprising AI Origin Story\n\nNvidia has only missed analysts’ estimates on quarterly revenue once in the past five years. And it has exceeded expectations by as much as 20% in recent periods, creating a high bar for its performance.\n\nIts data center division alone now has more revenue than rivals Intel and AMD have in total, combined. Net income this year is on course to exceed revenue at Intel, a business that was the chip industry’s biggest company for decades.\n\nNvidia made its name by selling graphics processors, but discovered that the technology also has applications for AI. Its chips help software models during the training process, when they learn to recognize and respond to real-world inputs. Nvidia’s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as ChatGPT.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company has rapidly expanded its product lineup to include networking, software and services, as well as fully built-out computer systems. Huang is traveling the world lobbying for a broader adoption of his technology and trying to spread its use by corporations and government agencies.\n\n“The age of AI is upon us and it’s large and diverse,” Huang said.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",
        "summary": "Nvidia Corp. has assured investors that its new Blackwell product lineup will drive continued growth in the AI sector, despite higher-than-expected production costs impacting profit margins. The company's sales forecast for the current period fell short of some Wall Street expectations, leading to a mixed reaction from investors, although Nvidia's shares have seen a significant rise this year. Nvidia's revenue has surged, with the data center unit doubling its revenue from the previous year, driven by strong demand for AI-related products. However, the company faces challenges with supply constraints and a heavy reliance on a small group of cloud service providers for its data center revenue. Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a leader in the AI chip market, with its technology widely used in AI model training and inference, and it continues to expand its product offerings and market reach.",

G6e instances can be used for a wide range of machine learning and spatial computing use cases. G6e instances deliver up to 2.5x better performance compared to G5 instances and up to 20% lower inference costs than P4d instances.\n\n\n\nCustomers can use G6e instances to deploy large language models (LLMs) with up to 13B parameters and diffusion models for generating images, video, and audio. Additionally, the G6e instances will unlock customers’ ability to create larger, more immersive 3D simulations and digital twins for spatial computing workloads. G6e instances feature up to 8 NVIDIA L40S Tensor Core GPUs with 384 GB of total GPU memory (48 GB of memory per GPU) and third generation AMD EPYC processors. They also support up to 192 vCPUs, up to 400 Gbps of network bandwidth, up to 1.536 TB of system memory, and up to 7.6 TB of local NVMe SSD storage. Developers can run AI inference workloads on G6e instances using AWS Deep Learning AMIs, AWS Deep Learning Containers, or managed services such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and AWS Batch, with Amazon SageMaker support coming soon.\n\n\n\nAmazon EC2 G6e instances are available today in the AWS US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Europe (Frankfurt, Spain) regions. Customers can purchase G6e instances as On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, or as part of Savings Plans.\n\n\n\nTo get started, visit the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs.

        "content": "Nvidia reported Q3 revenue of $35.1 billion, up 94% from last year with data center sales reaching $30.8 billion. Fellow tech firms showed mixed results, with Snowflake growing 29% to $900 million in revenue, while artificial intelligence (AI) startup BEN recorded $50,000 in its first significant quarterly sales amid mounting losses.\n\nNvidia’s Results Hit $35.1B on AI Surge\n\nNvidia reported third-quarter revenue of $35.1 billion, up 94% from a year ago and 17% from the previous quarter, as AI computing drives unprecedented chip demand.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California, semiconductor maker’s data center segment reached $30.8 billion in revenue, up 112% from last year and 17% from the previous quarter. This division now represents 88% of total revenue.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” CEO Jensen Huang said in the earnings release. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible.”\n\nNet income increased 109% to $19.3 billion, with earnings per share of $0.78, up 111% year over year. The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\nGaming revenue grew 15% year over year to $3.3 billion, and automotive revenue reached $449 million, up 72% from last year.\n\nThe results cement Nvidia’s dominance in AI computing hardware as companies expand their AI infrastructure globally.\n\nSnowflake Grows as Cloud Adoption Expands\n\nSnowflake, which markets itself as “the AI Data Cloud company,” reported third-quarter product revenue of $900.3 million, up 29% from a year earlier, while forecasting slower growth ahead.\n\n“Our obsessive drive to produce product cohesion and ease of use has built Snowflake into the easiest and most cost-effective enterprise data platform,” CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a news release.\n\nThe company’s remaining performance obligations, representing contracted future revenue, grew 55% to $5.7 billion. Snowflake expanded its base of large customers, now serving 542 organizations with trailing 12-month product revenue exceeding $1 million, up 25% year over year.\n\nSnowflake raised $2.27 billion in September through convertible notes offerings due 2027 and 2029.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects fourth-quarter product revenue between $906 million and $911 million, indicating year-over-year growth of approximately 23%.\n\nThe company posted a net loss of $327.9 million for the quarter, compared with $214.7 million a year earlier.\n\nBEN Reports Mixed Results\n\nBrand Engagement Network, an AI solutions provider, reported its first significant quarterly revenue of $50,000 while recording wider losses as it expands its healthcare AI partnerships.\n\n“We made significant progress in delivering secure, scalable AI solutions and advancing our mission to transform industries with intelligent technology,” said CEO Paul Chang in a news release.\n\nThe Wyoming company struck deals to deploy its AI assistants with KangarooHealth for remote patient monitoring and IntelliTek for healthcare operations. These partnerships aim to use BEN’s conversational AI technology to enhance patient engagement and chronic care management across multiple regions.\n\nHowever, operating losses widened to $5.82 million from $2.58 million a year earlier, reflecting heavy investment in AI development and expansion. The company secured a $50 million equity purchase agreement with Yorkville Advisors to fund growth and plans to acquire German tech firm Cataneo for $19.5 million by year end.\n\nThe company’s aggressive push into healthcare AI marks its strategy to commercialize its conversational AI technology in high-value sectors despite cash reserves dropping to $72,878 from $1.69 million at the start of the year.",

        "content": "Nvidia avoided the selloff many on Wall Street feared, in part because of another blowout earnings beat. Perhaps more important, the world’s largest company had plenty of good things to say about its next-generation offering of graphics processing units—the chips at the heart of the AI boom. On the company’s Q3 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said the rollout of the new platform, known as Blackwell, has avoided major issues and will start boosting the company’s top line ahead of schedule.\n\nOn the call, Huang brushed aside reported engineering snags, saying Nvidia is on track to outdo its prior Q4 estimates for Blackwell sales (he’s previously said the platform will initially account for several billion dollars in additional revenue). Huang touted ravenous demand for the new offering, which promises to dramatically boost AI data center performance.\n\n“Blackwell production is in full steam,” he said.\n\nThere’s broad consensus Blackwell will be a game changer, but the path to market has not been without recent hiccups. Multiple analysts have told Fortune that production snags, which delayed Blackwell’s release by at least a quarter, were not a surprise. Early this week, however, The Information reported Nvidia had asked suppliers to adjust the design of the platform’s server racks multiple times in recent months owing to overheating issues.\n\nWhile Huang did not specifically address the report, he said he believes the Blackwell ramp is in great shape.\n\n“He pretty much kind of threw cold water on all those concerns,” Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech analyst at CFRA Research, told Fortune after the call.\n\nHuang says AI capex isn’t going anywhere\n\nAnalysts on the earnings call also got assurance from Huang that demand will exceed supply for at least several more quarters. The first question the CEO fielded concerned a growing debate about whether advancements in large language models have stalled. That claim has been floated by the likes of Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, who suggested greater volumes of more powerful chips won’t be enough to produce further breakthroughs.\n\nHuang tried to assuage those concerns. The most recent large AI models, he said, required a maximum of 100,000 Nvidia Hopper chips, previously the company’s premier offering.\n\n“The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells,” he said.\n\nHuang cited numerous customers already up and running with the platform, including the likes of Google, Dell, and Oracle. Chief financial officer Colette Kress said Microsoft has seen performance increase more than two times compared with Hopper.\n\n“Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us,” she added.\n\nThat said, the company’s forecast of $37.5 billion in revenue for Q4, a slight beat on the Street’s consensus, was somewhat conservative, Zino noted. That caused the stock to dip slightly in after-hours trading before shares recovered those losses Thursday.\n\nThe muted forecast, he added, could set up an even stronger earnings beat in late February.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this view is shared by one of Wall Street’s most prominent tech bulls. Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Huang’s bullish commentary should send the stock’s bears into hibernation mode.\n\n“Nvidia and Jensen will continue to underpromise and overdeliver,” he wrote in a note Thursday.\n\nSo far, that’s been a good recipe for shares that have appreciated 850% over the past two years.",
        "summary": "Nvidia successfully avoided a feared selloff by delivering strong earnings and positive news about its next-generation graphics processing units, known as Blackwell, which are crucial to the AI boom. CEO Jensen Huang assured investors that despite reported engineering issues, Blackwell's rollout is on track and will exceed previous sales estimates, with high demand expected to boost AI data center performance. Although there were initial production delays due to design adjustments, Huang expressed confidence in the platform's progress and dismissed concerns about potential setbacks. Analysts were reassured that demand for Nvidia's products will continue to outpace supply, with major customers like Google, Dell, and Oracle already using Blackwell. Despite a conservative revenue forecast for Q4, Nvidia's strategy of underpromising and overdelivering has been effective, contributing to a significant increase in its stock value over the past two years.",

As such, he spent Wednesday evening telling Wall Street analysts about the important applications being made possible with the technology.\n\nAlso: Google's AI podcast tool transforms your text into stunningly lifelike audio - for free\n\nHuang emphasized one of his favorite applications, Google's Notebook LM, saying he \"used the living daylights\" out of the AI tool.\n\nThe NotebookLM program, which is free to use with a Google account, lets users upload documents and create a summary of their contents. It suggests questions to ask about the documents, engages in a chat about the documents, and it will even create an audio conversation about the contents between two speakers in the style of a podcast.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he has \"used the living daylights\" out of Google's NotebookLM program. Google\n\n\"I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it,\" he said.\n\nHuang talked about NotebookLM in response to one Wall Street stock analyst's question about the trends in \"inference,\" the practice of making predictions with an AI model after the model has been trained.\n\nAlso: Google's new AI tool could be your new favorite learning aid - and it's free\n\n\"Our hope and dream is that someday, the world does a ton of inference,\" replied Huang. \"That's when AI has really succeeded,\" he continued, \"is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies, for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding.\"\n\nHuang cited other examples of AI inference, such as \"physical AI,\" meaning AI models that \"understand the meaning of the structure\" of the physical world and how to \"reason\" about it. Such models can \"not only understand but can predict, roll out a short future.\"\n\nHuang is betting that inference tasks will be the new growth engine for his company's data center GPU chip sales, after having dominated the market for chips for training AI models for years.\n\nHuang told Wall Street his company's latest GPU, \"Blackwell,\" unveiled in March, is \"in great shape,\" and will generate billions of dollars of revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January.\n\n\"Blackwell production is in full steam,\" said Huang. \"We will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so, the supply chain team is doing an incredible job of working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply.\"",

It also gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that topped most analysts' expectations due to voracious demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. How Nvidia's stock performs has more impact than any other because it's grown into Wall Street's most valuable company at roughly $3.6 trillion. The frenzy around AI is sweeping up other stocks, and Snowflake jumped 32.7% after reporting stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

        "content": "FILE - Signs marking the intersection of Broad and Walls streets appear near the New York Stock Exchange, Oct. 1, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File)\n\nNvidia has once again turned out quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts. The company has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications.\n\nRevenue nearly doubled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, Nvidia reported Wednesday. The company expects further revenue growth in the current quarter that ends in January. Investors will be watching to see if demand for the company's next-generation AI chip called Blackwell can help it maintain the red-hot pace.\n\nThe company’s journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look.\n\nNvidia’s total market value as of the close Wednesday, tops in the S&P 500. It regained the No. 1 sport from Apple ($3.461 trillion) earlier this week. Microsoft is the only other company with a market value above $3 trillion ($3.089 trillion). One year ago, Nvidia's market value was around $1.243 trillion.\n\nGain in Nvidia's stock price so far this year as of the close of trading Wednesday. A $100,000 investment in Nvidia two years ago would now be worth more than $950,000. Shares fell about 1% in after-hours trading following the release of the company's earnings.\n\nThat's how much of the S&P 500's gain for the year could be attributed to Nvidia alone, as of Oct. 31. Nvidia replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this month.\n\nNvidia's revenue from its data center business for the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 112% from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 94% from a year ago to $35.1 billion. By comparison, revenue growth for all the companies in the S&P 500 is expected to be about 5.5% for the latest quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nNvidia's estimate for overall revenue in the fourth quarter, “plus or minus 2%.” That translates to a range of $36.8 billion to $38.3 billion, compared to Wall Street's estimate of $37.1 billion. Revenue in the year-ago fourth quarter totaled $22.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts’ estimate for Nvidia’s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That would be more than double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\nThe number of Thanksgiving meals one could buy with Nvidia's market value of $3.579 trillion, using the $65.51 estimated cost of a 15-item meal from retail intelligence provider Datasembly.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "content": "NVIDIA leads in high-performance computing, powering 384 systems from the TOP500 list.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has solidified its position as the driving force behind the world’s most powerful supercomputers, with its technology powering 384 systems on the prestigious TOP500 list. This achievement marks a significant milestone in the company’s journey since introducing CUDA in 2006, highlighting its dominant role in advancing AI and accelerated computing.\n\nWidespread Adoption of NVIDIA Technology\n\nThe latest TOP500 rankings demonstrate NVIDIA’s lead in high-performance computing, with 87% of new systems featuring acceleration capabilities. Among these accelerated systems, an impressive 85% utilize NVIDIA’s cutting-edge Hopper GPUs, enabling breakthrough advances in critical fields such as climate forecasting, drug discovery, and quantum simulation.\n\nInnovation Beyond Raw Performance\n\nNVIDIA’s approach to accelerated computing extends beyond traditional hardware performance metrics. At SC24, the company unveiled cuPyNumeric, a new addition to the NVIDIA CUDA-X library family. This innovation enables over 5 million developers to scale their Python code to powerful computing clusters without modification, lowering the barrier to high-performance computing.\n\nTo illustrate how its technology is being used, NVIDIA included several references in a blogpost. In his paper titled “Using Mixed Precision for Genomics,” David Keyes, a professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, used 0.8 exaflops of mixed precision to explore relationships between genomes and their generalized genotypes, and then to the prevalence of diseases to which they are subject.\n\nArvind Ramanathan, a computational biologist from the Argonne National Laboratory, harnessed 3 exaflops of AI performance on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper-powered Alps system to speed up protein design.\n\nThe company also announced significant updates to its NVIDIA CUDA-Q development platform, pushing the boundaries of quantum device simulation to previously unattainable levels.\n\nLeading in Sustainable Computing\n\nNVIDIA’s commitment to environmental responsibility is also evident in the Green500 rankings, where its technology powers eight of the top 10 energy-efficient supercomputers. The JEDI system at EuroHPC/FZJ stands out with an exceptional efficiency rating of 72.7 gigaflops per watt.\n\nTo address climate change challenges, NVIDIA introduced two new NVIDIA NIM microservices for its Earth-2 digital twin platform, enabling up to 500x faster climate change modeling and simulation.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWith over 190 exaflops of AI performance and 17 exaflops of single-precision capability across its platforms, NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries of scientific computing. The company’s balanced approach to performance and sustainability places it at the forefront of scientific discovery and technological innovation. NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform is truly setting new standards for the industry.\n\nEngage with StorageReview\n\nNewsletter | YouTube | Podcast iTunes/Spotify | Instagram | Twitter | TikTok | RSS Feed",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) development platform Lightning AI has obtained a $50 million equity investment.\n\nThe company, maker of the PyTorch Lightning open AI framework, announced the investment — from Cisco Investments, J.P. Morgan, K5 Global and Nvidia — in a news release Thursday (Nov. 21), saying it brings its total funding to $103 million.\n\n“Historically, enterprises have struggled with fragmented, in-house ML [machine learning] infrastructure requiring teams of engineers to maintain, which quickly becomes outdated,” the release said. “Lightning AI eliminates this complexity by unifying dozens of separate tools into one, multi-cloud platform, offering full, low-, and no-code solutions to train and deploy models, build intelligent agents, code together on cloud GPUs, host AI apps and more — all securely on enterprises’ preferred cloud infrastructure.”\n\nLaunched 12 months ago, Lightning AI has gained 240,000 users across 2,000 organizations, with PyTorch Lightning being downloaded more than 160 million times, the release said.\n\n“Building your own AI platform today is like building your own Slack — it’s complex, costly and not core to your business,” said William Falcon, Founder and CEO of Lightning AI. “The value for enterprises lies in their data, domain knowledge and unique models —not in maintaining AI infrastructure.”\n\nThe funding comes during the closing weeks of a year that has seen enterprise spending on generative AI increase sixfold, as businesses began incorporating the technology after first experimenting with it.\n\nThis spending reached $13.8 billion, compared to $2.3 billion last year, venture capital firm Menlo Ventures announced earlier this week.\n\n“2024 marks the year that generative AI became a mission-critical imperative for enterprise,” Joff Redfern, partner at Menlo, said in a news release. “The numbers tell a dramatic story of organizations moving beyond pilots to embedding AI at the core of their business strategies.”\n\nThe VC outfit said that 72% of enterprise IT decision-makers from companies with at least 50 employees expect to see wider adoption of generative AI “in the near term,” the release said.\n\nAt the same time, these officials said the transformation is not yet large in scale, as companies are seeking high-value use cases for the technology.\n\nMenlo’s findings are in line with research by PYMNTS Intelligence, which shows that 78% of chief financial officers say that their companies plan to increase spending on generative AI.",
        "summary": "Lightning AI, the developer of the PyTorch Lightning framework, has secured a $50 million investment from major investors, bringing its total funding to $103 million. The company aims to simplify AI infrastructure for enterprises by offering a unified, multi-cloud platform that integrates various tools for AI model training and deployment. Since its launch a year ago, Lightning AI has attracted 240,000 users from 2,000 organizations, with its framework downloaded over 160 million times. The investment comes amid a significant increase in enterprise spending on generative AI, which has grown from $2.3 billion to $13.8 billion in a year. Research indicates that a majority of enterprise IT leaders anticipate broader adoption of generative AI, although they are still identifying high-value applications for the technology.",

The average price target for Nvidia is $167, representing potential upside of 15% from current levels.",

        "content": "Dell and Nvidia aim to reshape enterprise AI amid industry transition\nAI is driving a seismic shift in enterprise infrastructure, with companies racing to integrate cutting-edge technologies into their operations. Things are moving quickly, and Dell Technologies Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are aiming to change the game on the data center with Dell AI Factory solutions.\nThe goal of Dell AI Factory is to get something that is massively scalable. From there, people can start out with whatever their early workloads are, according to Adam Glick (pictured, right), senior director of AI portfolio marketing at Dell.\n“They can start small and literally just stack that up, not only just within a rack, but create rack scale deployments,” Glick said of Dell AI Factory solutions. “We make it super simple to be able to take the hardware. We’ve worked a lot with our friends at Nvidia. There’s a lot of work that’s gone together to integrate these two pieces.”\nGlick and Jason Schroedl (left), director of product marketing for enterprise platforms at Nvidia, spoke with theCUBE Research’s John Furrier and Dave Vellante at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the transformative impact of AI infrastructure on enterprise productivity and what’s available through Dell AI Factory solutions. (* Disclosure below.)\nDell AI Factory solutions in detail\nIt’s not just the hardware pieces and machines that go together. It’s also the networking and the software stack, according to Glick.\n“Tested, integrated, optimized to be able to deploy that and deploy it fast and at scale, to deliver solutions that our customers are looking for,” Glick said.\nFor Nvidia, there’s a completely new paradigm at play. Companies are reinventing their AI infrastructure with concepts like the AI Factory, according to Schroedl.\n“We packaged this up in a simplified solution that can help companies get up and running very quickly, leveraging all the best practice and learnings that we’ve done at large scale, bringing that to the enterprise, helping them wherever they are on their journey, whether they’re just getting started with generative AI or whether they’re looking to go from proof of concept to proof of value,” he said.\nMeanwhile, the democratization of AI is empowering companies and individuals to innovate at unprecedented scales. Today, companies that are investing in generative AI are beginning to see tremendous advantages, according to Schroedl.\n“I think the difference that you’ll see is the existing companies that are leveraging generative AI, deploying those use cases, are going to be the ones that win in their industry,” he said. “There will be new entrants that’ll also disrupt those industries. They may take share, but the companies that don’t get started today with generative AI, they’re going to be left behind.”\nThe AI transformation taking place is really a Cambrian explosion, according to Glick. There’s likely to be greater and greater adoption in the months and years ahead.\n“The organizations that get in sooner, they’re going to get the greatest advantage out of that, because everything has a learning curve,” Glick said. “As much as we try and integrate it, make it fast for people, everyone goes through that curve. We try and flatten that curve for folks, but ultimately you’ve got to get on the curve in order to start to get that benefit.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: Dell Technologies Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "The Dow soared more than 600 points during Thursday’s session to a one-week high, as Wall Street’s main indexes turned positive after choppy trading on Thursday.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 461.88 points, or 1.1%, to 43,870.35, hitting a one-week high.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 0.5%, and the Nasdaq was flat%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow jumped more than 600 points on Thursday before closing up 461 points. Getty Images\n\nThe Dow’s gains were aided by cloud company Salesforce’s 3.1% advance after three brokerages lifted their price targets on the stock.\n\nShares of Wall Street’s biggest company, Nvidia, were up 0.5% after teetering following its earnings release on Wednesday. The chip company surpassed expectations for quarterly results, and projected fourth-quarter revenue above estimates.\n\n“[Nvidia’s] earnings report was really, really good. Some of the whisper numbers were higher and they disappointed there, but the fundamentals of AI and Nvidia continue to fire on all cylinders and the outlook for next year is positive,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\nSome investors were unimpressed that the forecast was its slowest in seven quarters.\n\nAlphabet slid 4.6% to touch a more than two-week low after the Justice Department argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its monopoly on online search.\n\nThe Nasdaq reversed earlier losses as shares of Google parent Alphabet dropped. REUTERS\n\nAmazon lost 2.2% after a report said it will likely face an EU investigation next year into whether it favors its own brand products on its online marketplace.\n\nOn the data front, a weekly report on jobless claims showed they fell unexpectedly last week, suggesting a rebound in job growth in November.\n\nInvestors will be closely monitoring commentary from Federal Reserve officials before the mid-December FOMC meeting.\n\nMoney-market bets are in favor of a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Fed in December, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch.\n\n“We’ve moved on from the election a bit, we got the Nvidia report, so the next thing markets will look for is the Fed meeting, and some policy speak from Fed officials this week have pointed to maybe a pause in the making for December,” Saglimbene said.\n\nRichmond Fed President Tom Barkin said the United States is more vulnerable to inflationary shocks than in the past, according to a media report.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said on Thursday he supports further interest rate cuts and is open to doing them more slowly.\n\nTraders also monitored geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia that sent crude prices higher and aided a 0.8% gain in the energy sector.\n\nShares of machinery manufacturer Deere gained 8.1% after reporting an upbeat fourth-quarter profit, while AI company Snowflake jumped 33% to $171.35 after raising its annual product revenue forecast.",
        "summary": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 600 points during Thursday's session, closing up 461.88 points, driven by gains in Salesforce and Nvidia. Nvidia's strong earnings report and positive outlook for AI contributed to market optimism, despite some investor concerns about its slower forecast. Alphabet's shares fell 4.6% following a Justice Department argument against Google's monopoly, while Amazon's stock dropped 2.2% amid potential EU investigation news. Jobless claims unexpectedly fell, indicating potential job growth in November, and investors are watching for Federal Reserve commentary ahead of the mid-December meeting, with expectations of a possible interest rate cut. Additionally, geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia pushed crude prices higher, benefiting the energy sector, while Deere and Snowflake saw significant stock gains due to positive earnings and revenue forecasts.",

        "content": "After reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings that topped expectations, Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) shares dipped in extended trading on Wednesday; investors wanted more action from the chip giant.\n\nNvidia projects sales of $37.5 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, plus or minus 2%. Although this advice is below some buy-side projections as high as $41 billion, it exceeds analyst predictions of $37.1 billion.\n\nWith sales jumping 94% year-over-year to $35.08 billion, Nvidia posted adjusted profits of $0.81 per share for the quarter ended Oct. 27. While automobile income came in at $449 million, data center revenue came in at $30.8 billion, above projections of $29.14 billion. Revenue from professional visualization climbed 17% annually to $486 million.\n\nGaming income for the quarter is at $3.3 billion, which is above projections of $3.06 billion and up 15% from the year before. With a 75% adjusted gross margin that matched projections, the business produced $16.79 billion in free cash flow.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts had projected profits of $0.74 per share on $33.25 billion in sales.\n\nThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing, said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell in full production are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference.\n\nHuang added, AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI. And countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the business, for many quarters into fiscal 2026 demand for their Blackwell chips is projected to surpass supply. Notwithstanding supply limits, Nvidia intends to keep delivering Hopper and Blackwell in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAnalyst Julian Lin noted on the direction that Nvidia lives in the \"same mathematical reality.\"\n\nFollowing Nvidia's results, shares of rival semiconductor firms, including AMD (AMD, Financials), ARM (ARM, Financials), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials), and Intel (INTC, Financials), slumped in after-hours trade.\n\nWith a record date of Dec. 5, Nvidia said it would pay a quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share to owners on Dec. 27.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

        "content": "Despite Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25% ) modest guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter, analysts are anticipating larger earnings beats on strong demand for its new artificial intelligence platform.\n\nHow AI investment tools avoid costly hallucinations, according to an exec CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video How AI investment tools avoid costly hallucinations, according to an exec\n\nHow AI investment tools avoid costly hallucinations, according to an exec CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish How AI investment tools avoid costly hallucinations, according to an exec\n\nThe chipmaker set its fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above expectations of $37.09 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.34% ). Nvidia’s expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter were “likely hampered by ongoing Blackwell shipment constraints,” Kunjan Sobhani, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. Nvidia chief executive Colette Kress said both Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are facing certain supply constraints, and that Blackwell demand is expected to exceed supply into fiscal year 2026. The modest guidance sent Nvidia’s shares slightly down in after-hours trading on Wednesday into Thursday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Unfortunately, market participants have become too short-term oriented,” Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Absolute good reports seem less interesting than relatively less good but still good. There is nothing wrong with NVDA, I suggest investors use any weakness to buy the stock because demand will be satisfied at some point and these slight misses will turn into big beats yet again.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the company’s earnings call, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said production of its Blackwell AI platform “is in full steam” after a design flaw was fixed, and that the company expects to deliver more Blackwells in this quarter than previously estimated. In the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia said it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell chips to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we’re going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year,” Huang said.\n\nNvidia is likely “sold out” of Blackwell until the end of next year, and “has much better visibility in its forecasts than it is letting on,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This allows it to offer guidance that it knows it can beat by a small margin, which will help the share price hold onto the massive rally it has enjoyed over the last 18 months,” Windsor said.\n\nNvidia’s shares are up over 198% so far this year.\n\nConcerns with Blackwell’s commercial deliveries have not reflected in Nvidia’s earnings reports yet, likely because issues mostly center on data center infrastructure around the chips, and because customers don’t want “to lose their place in the queue” and are therefore buying Blackwell and fixing issues after, Windsor said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuang addressed a report that Blackwell chips are overheating in custom-designed server racks, saying “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” He also said Nvidia plans “to execute on our annual road map” of producing new chips.\n\nJefferies (JEF+2.33% ) analysts said in a note that they “are not overly concerned with any of the issues on this call” and that they “see increasing beats as Blackwell ramps.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut strong demand for Blackwell and Nvidia’s ability to deliver to customers despite production issues might not sustain growth in the long-term.\n\n“Despite demand in the near-term continuing to be strong, we still believe a decline in demand for NVIDIA compute is inevitable as customers begin to scrutinize their ROI on AI compute,” analysts at D.A. Davidson said in a note.",
        "summary": "Nvidia provided modest guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter, citing supply constraints for its Blackwell and Hopper platforms, but analysts expect larger earnings due to strong demand for its AI technology. Despite these constraints, Nvidia's shares have risen significantly this year, and the company is working to increase production of Blackwell chips, which are currently sold out until the end of next year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang assured that production issues have been addressed and that the company is on track to deliver more Blackwell chips than previously estimated. Analysts believe Nvidia is strategically offering conservative guidance to maintain its share price momentum, and they are not overly concerned about the reported issues. However, some analysts caution that while demand is strong now, a decline may occur as customers evaluate the return on investment for AI compute.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is assuaging Wall Street’s concerns about any potential slowdowns in the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip, telling investors during the company’s earnings call on Wednesday that it’s on pace to exceed its previous revenue estimates for the current quarter.\n\n“Blackwell production is in full steam,” CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.”\n\nPrior to the earnings call, The Information reported on Nov. 17 that Nvidia was contending with overheating issues related to its Blackwell-based servers leading suppliers to adjust the design of the racks that house the servers. Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected.\n\nThe report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time.\n\nNow Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that.\n\n• USD (NVDA) View Quote Details\n\nRead more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest?\n\n“With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.”\n\nBut there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand.\n\n“It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.”\n\nCEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFor some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.\n\nThe H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible.\n\nStory Continues",
        "summary": "Nvidia has reassured investors that the production of its next-generation Blackwell chip is progressing well, despite earlier reports of overheating issues and design adjustments. CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that Blackwell production is on track, and the chips are already in the hands of major partners like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, which are crucial for Nvidia's data center revenue. While Nvidia is executing the Blackwell ramp-up effectively, supply constraints remain a challenge due to high demand from companies eager to acquire the advanced chips. The demand for Nvidia's chips is driven by the ongoing generative AI revolution, with companies like Meta using large quantities of Nvidia's previous-generation H100 chips for AI model training. Nvidia's ability to meet this demand is vital for its continued growth, as Blackwell promises significant performance improvements over its predecessor.",

        "content": "TL;DR: Nvidia has posted record revenue for the third quarter ending October 27, 2024, serving as further proof that the age of AI is in full steam. For the three-month period, Nvidia generated $35.1 billion in revenue. That is an increase of 17 percent compared to the previous quarter and a whopping 94 percent more than it brought in during the same period a year earlier.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $0.81 – up 19 percent sequentially and 103 percent from a year ago. For reference, analysts were expecting $33.2 billion in revenue and EPS of $0.74.\n\nThe vast majority of Nvidia's earnings came from the data center division, which generated $30.8 billion. That's up 17 percent quarter over quarter and 112 percent compared to Q3 2023. Gaming revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion – an increase of 14 percent versus last quarter and 15 percent from a year earlier.\n\nSpeaking of gaming, it was just over a month ago that Nvidia celebrated the 25th anniversary of the original GeForce card, the GeForce 256. That legendary unit dropped on October 11, 1999, and was marketed as the world's first GPU. While not the first aftermarket graphics card I would own, it was the first to be slotted into my first custom-built PC. I still remember being surprised to see the active cooling solution when I unboxed it. My, how time flies.\n\nShares in Nvidia are down 2.44 percent on the earnings report as of this writing to $142.33, but are still up nearly 195 percent year to date and more than 2,600 percent over the last five years. Nvidia's recent success has also made CEO Jensen Huang one of the richest people in the world.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia forecasts revenue of $37.5 billion (plus or minus two percent) for the fourth quarter with gross margins between 73 percent and 73.5 percent. For comparison, Wall Street is expecting $37 billion in revenue from Nvidia in the final quarter of the year.",
        "summary": "Nvidia reported record revenue of $35.1 billion for the third quarter ending October 27, 2024, marking a 17% increase from the previous quarter and a 94% increase from the same period last year. The company's non-GAAP earnings per share rose to $0.81, surpassing analyst expectations of $0.74. The data center division was the primary driver of this growth, generating $30.8 billion, while gaming revenue also saw an increase to $3.3 billion. Despite the strong financial performance, Nvidia's shares fell by 2.44% following the earnings report, although they remain significantly higher year-to-date and over the past five years. Looking forward, Nvidia projects fourth-quarter revenue of $37.5 billion, slightly above Wall Street's expectation of $37 billion.",

        "content": "My time studying and engaging in philosophy has had me considering more than my fair share of different perspectives on the same underlying phenomena, but even I scratched my head upon hearing Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang's latest take on AI. This being that AI is generated just like electricity, which implies it's a resource or commodity.\n\nTo be more specific, in a recent earnings call (via Motley Fool) the Huangster stated: \"Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7.\"\n\nIt sounds like marketing hype, but if so then Huang is quite committed to the bit. He continued: \"Today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so, we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is.\"\n\nOkay, but maybe it's just hyperbole, you know, something tha-\n\n\"When we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something.\"\n\nOkay, so it's a serious claim, then. Let's give the devil his due.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction is to say there's no way AI is similar to electricity as a kind of commodity. This reaction's probably best encapsulated by the absurd image of going to top up your AI card at the store and then popping it into your AI meter at home to get your AI back online.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBut that's not really fair, is it? It's a bit of a caricature of Huang's position which, to be honest, does make at least some sense. \"Resource\" can mean money, materials, capital, and even people (you know \"human resources\"). \"Commodity\" can mean anything that's traded, bought, or sold.\n\nIn this sense, pretty much anything can be a resource or commodity, and the scandalous huckster in me wants to agree: \"There's a price for everything\", I say, smiling to reveal a glimmer from my golden tooth.\n\nIf money's just an abstract middleman for bartering actual resources, the proverbial Huangian might claim that these resources themselves are surely no less ephemeral and up for debate. In a hypothetical world—call it \"Twigland\"—where people have an insatiable craving for twigs, particularly twigglesome trees would be resource number one. It all comes down to what we value.\n\nAnd Huang could have his finger on the pulse regarding what we're coming to value, this being AI. Huang says that we're seeing the beginning of a \"widespread\" shift that sees us \"moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs\", and that \"there are no companies who are not going to do machine learning\".\n\nIn which case, AI compute could become so ubiquitous that it'd be considered as twigs to Twiglanders. If CPU processing really does become second-rung to machine learning for neural network processing, such a conclusion would make sense.\n\nBut even so, would it be a resource like electricity?\n\nIf we say yes then where do we draw the line? It seems there'd be no meaningful distinction between a \"resource\" like electricity and anything else we value. Surely resources have to have some productive weight behind them—you know, to be far back enough in the chain that they're used as resources for multiple other things, like how electricity powers my computer as well as the traffic lights.\n\nBut then maybe Huang would say that's exactly the point: AI is going to be used for so many vitally necessary things: research, medical treatments, home computing, and so on.\n\nPerhaps the only way to win the argument would be to cut off the power to the AI data centres. We'll see how AI stacks up against electricity then, Mr. Huang.",
        "summary": "The author reflects on Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang's analogy of AI being generated like electricity, suggesting it could be considered a resource or commodity. Huang describes AI services as \"AI factories\" running continuously, similar to electricity generators, indicating a shift towards machine learning on GPUs over traditional CPU coding. The author initially finds this comparison exaggerated but acknowledges that, like any resource or commodity, AI's value depends on societal demand and usage. Huang's perspective suggests AI could become as ubiquitous and essential as electricity, powering various sectors such as research and medical treatments. The author questions whether AI can truly be equated to electricity, pondering the implications of such a comparison and the potential necessity of AI in the future.",

        "content": "Industrial engineers are turning to AI to build advanced process simulation solutions and accelerate progress toward fully autonomous operations in the energy, power, and chemicals industries.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents, infused with AI, are helping transition traditional industrial automation to industrial autonomy for core control, field, and production processes. This use of agentic AI for advanced reasoning and iterative planning with human-in-the-loop aims to enable new applications in advanced industrial control, system-level autonomy, and fully autonomous plants.\n\nIn this post, we explore how AVEVA, a leader in industrial software, integrated its Dynamic Simulation platform with the NVIDIA Raptor DRL engine to maximize industrial plant production, reduce unplanned downtime, and enhance product quality.\n\nFigure 1. AVEVA’s scale for industrial automation to industrial autonomy\n\nChallenges and benefits of industrial automation\n\nConventional advanced control technologies, such as advanced process control or closed-loop real-time optimization are best-fit for repeatable processes. This occurs when plant conditions are relatively constant to optimize energy consumption, emissions, and production. However, industrial plants undergo transient events, such as imposed feed changes or unexpected disturbances, which are difficult to control using either base level or advanced process controls.\n\nIn these dynamic situations, industrial plant operators switch to manual control to re-stabilize the plant and avoid unwanted and expensive consequences, such as a power plant trip when a power-generating turbine is automatically shut down due to an unexpected event.\n\nBy achieving greater industrial autonomy, plant operators, managers, and engineers can achieve several benefits:\n\nEnhanced safety : Reduces worker exposure to hazardous environments.\n\n: Reduces worker exposure to hazardous environments. Increased operational efficiency : Optimizes production and equipment use.\n\n: Optimizes production and equipment use. Cost reduction : Optimizes labor and maintenance costs.\n\n: Optimizes labor and maintenance costs. Improved decision-making : AI-driven insights for better accuracy and performance.\n\n: AI-driven insights for better accuracy and performance. Environmental sustainability : Optimizes resource usage and reduces emissions.\n\n: Optimizes resource usage and reduces emissions. Scalability : Enables efficient management of large or remote operations.\n\n: Enables efficient management of large or remote operations. Connected remote operations: Centralized control of geographically dispersed assets.\n\nBuilding an industrial automation strategy\n\nAVEVA and Schneider Electric are bringing their industrial expertise to collaborate with NVIDIA across industrial process, hybrid and compute infrastructure use cases:\n\nAutonomous AI agents trained using physically accurate industrial digital process twins at scale on a high-speed compute architecture.\n\nHigh-fidelity digital twins at scale for industrial 3D environments and unified operation centers to monitor and control industrial operations in real time.\n\nData center reference designs for NVIDIA-accelerated compute clusters that enable operators to support AI workloads on their data center infrastructure, improving the speed of deployment and reliable life-cycle operation.\n\nResults of AVEVA Dynamic Simulation with NVIDIA Raptor\n\nAVEVA Dynamic Simulation, a rigorous first-principles simulator for industrial processes, was tested using an integration with NVIDIA Raptor, a deep reinforcement learning engine.\n\nAVEVA Dynamic Simulation is used to build dynamic simulation twins of process plants for operator training simulators, control checkouts, and process design across multiple use cases.\n\nFigure 2. AVEVA Dynamic Simulation dashboard\n\nIndustrial engineers use AVEVA Dynamic Simulation to reduce operating costs, speed time to market for industrial products, enhance worker safety, and optimize plant uptime across a variety of heavy industries.\n\nFigure 3. Key use cases for AVEVA Dynamic Simulation in industrial process simulation\n\nRaptor was trained offline using AVEVA’s dynamic process simulation of industrial process plants. Raptor enables large-scale reinforcement learning training using accelerated computing on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nNVIDIA used the Raptor framework internally for chip design using reinforcement learning. Using Raptor, NVIDIA generated arithmetic circuits with a 25% smaller footprint, while maintaining similar performance and accuracy to leading electronic design automation software solutions. Because Raptor supports a wide range of reinforcement learning algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, it can be put to use to solve industrial problems such as AVEVA Dynamic Simulation.\n\nThe AVEVA Dynamic Simulation model environment takes an action from the NVIDIA Raptor deep reinforcement learning agent, outputting a new state to Raptor. At each step, the DRL agent gets a reward depending on whether its action resulted in a better or worse state. Raptor learns by maximizing rewards over a series of actions.\n\nWhen trained, the resulting control policy can be deployed in the plant control system:\n\nMinimize production impact of plant upset by stabilizing product quality in a shorter time than a manual plant operator.\n\nImprove control of batch processes to deliver consistent and repeatable product quality.\n\nReduce complex startup and shutdown times to maximize production throughput.\n\nFigure 4. AVEVA Dynamic Simulation generates states and rewards, and NVIDIA Raptor DRL agents generate control policies\n\nAn example industrial problem is a chemical distillation process to separate heavier propane from lighter methane and ethane. When the incoming feed changes by a larger-than-expected amount, the industrial process is disturbed and conventional controls might not manage levels and product qualities in the correct ranges. Normally, this would require plant operator intervention.\n\nA Raptor DRL agent was trained using AVEVA Dynamic Simulation to control heat input to the column, column bottoms level, and reflux drum level. As a result, the DRL agent could stabilize the distillation system twice as fast as a manual plant operator with temperature and product quality remaining in the correct ranges even during large changes in feed, in contrast to conventional industrial base controls.\n\nFigure 5. Distillation system example\n\nFuture of industrial-process simulation\n\nAI and deep reinforcement learning are enabling industrial plant process control to achieve greater levels of autonomy. AVEVA’s accurate process digital twins and the NVIDIA-accelerated computing platform are driving innovation in industrial process simulation from proof of concept to real-world deployments.\n\nThe next steps for AVEVA are to pilot, productize, and scale AVEVA Dynamic Simulation with Raptor. AVEVA plans to work with some of the world’s biggest energy companies to pilot the solution—an essential first step for customers to gain confidence. A key advantage is that AVEVA Dynamic Simulation with Raptor can be trained, tested, and proven entirely off-line from the actual industrial power plant.\n\nAfter customer pilots have successfully been completed, AVEVA will look to productize and scale up the solution using no-code workflows in AVEVA Connect. This will enable faster training using the NVIDIA-accelerated computing platform with plug-and-play modules for testing and deployment of deep reinforcement learning agents.\n\nLearn more about the AVEVA and NVIDIA collaboration in industrial process simulation.

        "content": "This is the published version of Forbes’ CIO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief innovation officers and other technology-focused leaders. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.\nYesterday, I attended the Forbes CIO Summit in New York City. It was a great opportunity to meet tech leaders from around the country, discuss some of the issues facing CIOs now and in the future, and get new perspectives on the challenges CIOs see.\nI spent part of the day moderating two panel discussions on topics I find myself writing about week after week—cybersecurity and making data useful for AI—but I also sat in the audience to listen in on the other discussions. One of my favorite moments was during an open forum about adoption of digital tools moderated by my colleague Alex Konrad and featuring panelists Land O’Lakes CTO Teddy Bekele, SolarWinds CISO Tim Brown, and cofounder and managing partner of FPV Ventures Pegah Ebrahimi. The question was about how widespread adoption of AI was impacting what the CIO’s role in a company would be. Bluntly, whether CIO now stood for “chief innovation officer” or “career is over.”\nEbrahimi responded that it actually could be the latter, depending on what a CIO is doing in their role. “As a CIO, you need to be talking to all the business leaders,” she said. “You need to at least have some agenda in the boardroom to say, ‘Okay, on the product we’re doing this, but here’s how we’re enabling on the technology side.’ I think you have to think of yourself as more of a technology leader that is thinking in business ways. And to do that it means having much more relationships on that front.”\nBrown added that the CIO’s job has been one directing transitions for the last several years. Before the transition to AI, CIOs were leading the transition to the cloud—and many are still working on that one, he added. Today’s successful CIO needs to be not just enabling tech transitions, but embracing them. “The change brings a lot of opportunity, and those opportunities are generally not necessarily driven by the business. They’re driven by the technologies that make things possible,” he said.\nBekele agreed with his fellow panelists. “We’re driving the change. We’re bringing the technology, and that’s what’s going to empower either existing business models or new business models,” he said.\nThat empowerment demonstrates both why the CIO’s job is interesting, but also why it continues to be vital. Today’s business world runs on technology, and tech professionals who bring their knowledge and knowhow to the table can make bigger changes to the entire enterprise than most executives.\nWe’ll be taking a break from publishing Forbes CIO next week for the Thanksgiving holiday, and back in your inboxes on December 5.\nLEGAL ISSUES\nThe federal government asked a judge to force Google to sell its Chrome browser and change how search works on Android mobile devices. This proposed judgment follows the August ruling that Google has maintained an illegal monopoly on search. The Justice Department wants Google to be barred from entering the web browser market for five years and couldn’t own or invest in any search text-based advertising rival company. Chrome commands roughly two-thirds of the browser market, and government antitrust lawyers argued that its dominance there has illegally forcibly channeled users to Google’s search and other products. Selling Chrome, the government argued in a court filing, would “permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet.” The government is not asking that Android be divested at this time, but instead that the mobile phone operating system no longer default to Google Search.\nGoogle responded that forcing it to sell Chrome is “unprecedented government overreach.” In a blog post, Google President for Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker writes that this move would “push a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products—even beyond Search—that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.”\nForbes senior contributor Barry Collins writes that this order would be challenging to enforce. Chrome is built on the open source browser engine Chromium, which is also the basis of Microsoft Edge and Vivaldi. (Though, he points out, Google engineers have been the biggest contributors to the Chromium project, which could be disrupted by a Chrome sale.) What Google would essentially be selling is its user base, a huge commodity with few obvious potential buyers.\nWhat ultimately happens is up to U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who issued the ruling against Google this summer. He will hold a hearing on the request in April, and expects a final ruling by Labor Day 2025. But the Justice Department’s position may change between now and then, as President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump is seen as more tech- and business-friendly—but maybe he won’t be when the company involved is Google.\nNOTABLE EARNINGS\nA pattern is repeating itself: The market gears up for Nvidia’s earnings, seeing the AI chip company’s stock price soar in anticipation in the days before the report. Then the world’s most valuable company actually reports its earnings, smashing records and expectations for sales, revenues and growth. And then Nvidia’s stock price immediately drops.\nIt happened again after markets closed on Wednesday. Here are the particulars: Nvidia’s quarterly revenues were $35.1 billion, 94% above the same time last year and far ahead of expectations of $33.2 billion. Its revenue estimates for the next quarter are $37.5 billion, above consensus forecasts of $37.09 billion. CFO Collette Kress said there is “staggering” demand for the company’s new Blackwell processing unit. And the stock fell 3% almost immediately.\nThe reason is likely the overwhelming hype around Nvidia’s GPU business. The company creates much of the hardware that all AI platforms depend on. But some investors may have come to expect consistent exponential growth from Nvidia, and even though the company continues to outperform more grounded investors’ expectations, the future growth isn’t quite as high as it has been. “There is a risk here … that Nvidia’s current overearning will begin to come to an end,” William de Gale, lead portfolio manager of BlueBox Asset Management’s global technology fund, told CNBC. “There’s considerable risk in this name at the moment. But it’s exciting.”\nThe volatility continued on Thursday. Soon after markets opened, Nvidia’s stock rose to an all-time high of $152.89, but then swooped back down, quickly showing an 8% drop from the high, and recording a net decline of more than 1% by midday.\nCYBERSECURITY\nThe Open Cybersecurity Schema Foundation joined the Linux Foundation earlier this week, aiming to drive more open and accessible cybersecurity plans across industries. Forbes senior contributor Tony Bradley writes that the Linux Foundation’s long history of fostering open source projects, development and adoption makes it an ideal partner for the OCSF. The cybersecurity foundation was cofounded by AWS and Splunk in 2022 to address the challenges of sharing cybersecurity data across different organizations—including devising a common language and data protocols. In two years, the OCSF has grown from 18 founding members to more than 900 collaborators. Joining with the Linux Foundation will help OCSF advance its mission to increase awareness, education and collaboration, as well as better sharing of information on risks and solutions.\nDEEP DIVE\nThe Forbes CIO Next List: 2024\nWhen companies are thinking about what they want to add in the future, it’s a lot about AI. And as Forbes put together its fifth annual list of the 50 CIOs who are leading the way into the technology of tomorrow, bullish attitudes toward AI adoption were a common feature. The 2024 Forbes CIO Next List, released earlier this week, showcases the best, brightest and most impactful.\nThis year’s honorees include tech leaders from government, and businesses big and small. NASA CIO Jeff Seaton was recognized for his dedication to improving the space exploration agency’s infrastructure. It’s a difficult task, he told Forbes’ Alex Knapp, because of the large amount of data and infrastructure that are under NASA’s purview—including older spacecraft that are millions of miles away from Earth like Voyager, mission data for Mars rovers, the International Space Station and the Artemis project that will return humans to the Moon. NASA has also increased its public-facing web presence, with video streaming, photos and data.\nGoogle Cloud CISO Phil Venables (who will be featured in a Forbes CIO newsletter Q&A next month) was also recognized for his cybersecurity management of one of the largest cloud providers in the world—and by extension, thousands of smaller customers. He told Forbes’ Richard Nieva that his job is not only about security, it’s also about working with customers who are deploying AI. He helped put together Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF), a set of guidelines and best practices for security professionals to safeguard their AI initiatives. Last month, Google launched a free risk assessment tool for companies to evaluate their security situations, which creates a personalized report with potential threats, and suggestions on how to mitigate them.\nOther honorees who have been profiled in Forbes CIO in the last year include Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj and PagerDuty CIO Eric Johnson.\nFACTS + COMMENTS\nChip maker AMD announced job cuts last week as it works toward becoming a more dominant player in AI hardware.\n4%: Proportion of employees AMD is cutting, which works out to about 1,000\n18%: Overall year-over-year increase in AMD’s revenue in its most recent quarterly report.

        "content": "US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line.\n\nInvestors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech.\n\nNvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026.\n\nThat suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday.\n\n• USD (^GSPC) View Quote Details\n\nElsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER\n\n22 updates",

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares dropped nearly 2% today's morning, despite the company smashing expectations with Q3 revenue of $35.1 billionup a jaw-dropping 94% year-on-yearand adjusted earnings per share of $0.81, beating Wall Street's predictions. But here's the catch: growth is slowing. After triple-digit percentage gains earlier this year, Nvidia's sequential growth now sits at 17%. And in a market where insane demand for GPUs is the norm, investors are asking: has the AI-driven boom hit its peak?\n\nCEO Jensen Huang isn't hitting the brakes, though. In his words, The age of AI is in full steam, with Nvidia at the epicenter of a global AI revolution. Record data center revenues of $30.8 billion underscore Nvidia's dominance in powering AI supercomputers, from Denmark to Japan, and fueling innovations across industries from telecom to robotics. Yet, with competitors like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) nipping at its heels, Nvidia faces the double-edged sword of market saturation and sky-high expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia forecasts $37.5 billion in revenue for Q4, which sounds soliduntil you realize it's not the rocket-ship growth we've been seeing. For investors, the big question is simple: can Nvidia keep the AI train on track, or is this the start of a slowdown? With shares down and growth cooling, Nvidia remains a must-watch stock, but the risks are rising in tandem with the hype.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

However, growth is slowing, with sequential growth now at 17%, raising concerns about whether the AI-driven boom has peaked. CEO Jensen Huang remains optimistic, emphasizing Nvidia's central role in the AI revolution, supported by record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. Despite this, Nvidia faces challenges from competitors like AMD and Intel, as well as market saturation and high expectations. Looking forward, Nvidia projects $37.5 billion in Q4 revenue, but investors are questioning if the company can maintain its momentum amid cooling growth and rising risks.",

        "content": "US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line.\n\nInvestors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech.\n\nNvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026.\n\nThat suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday.\n\n• USD (^GSPC) View Quote Details\n\nElsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025.

Here’s how it works\n\nNvidia is yet to make the next generation of RTX GPUs that it's making an official product, but leaks continue to roll out. The latest report has information on the RTX 5070 Ti that's seemingly in development at the hardware giant. The latest round of leaks joins the ones that already have come out regarding the highest-end RTX 5090, as well as its smaller brothers: the RTX 5080 and 5070.\n\nThe latest RTX 5000 series report once again lands from a well-known hardware leaker, Kopite7kimi, via VideoCardz.\n\nPer the report, the RTX 5070 Ti will tout 8960 CUDA Cores, which translate to 70 Streaming Multiprocessors. Using the leaker's new information that reports Nvidia is calling the card \"PG147 and \"SKU 60\" internally, the site alleges that this lineup will be using the same reference boards as the RTX 5080, that being a cut-down GB203 GPU.\n\nThe leaker had gone on to say that the RTX 5070 Ti will have a 300W power requirement. However, as VideoCardz notes, it's unclear if this is measuring the maximum (TGP) or the thermal design power (TDP) of the graphics card. Previous leaks of the unannounced RTX 5070 had said the relatively lower-end GPU would draw 250W of power. Based on that data, the more powerful Ti version drawing 50W of extra power makes some sense.\n\nWith so many rumors swirling about the unannounced line of RTX graphics cards, even if the specifications turn out to be correct, keep in mind that their names may not be what appears out of Nvidia in the end.\n\nWith the production of RTX 40 series GPUs now winding down and a CES 2025 keynote ready to happen in January, Nvidia is looking quite eager to announce its new consumer graphics card lineup. As usual, take rumors with a grain of salt until official announcements come through from the company.",
        "summary": "Nvidia is reportedly developing the next generation of RTX GPUs, including the RTX 5070 Ti, with leaks suggesting it will feature 8960 CUDA Cores and 70 Streaming Multiprocessors. The RTX 5070 Ti is expected to use the same reference boards as the RTX 5080, with a power requirement of 300W, though it's unclear if this refers to the maximum power or thermal design power. Previous leaks indicated that the RTX 5070 would draw 250W, making the 5070 Ti's higher power draw plausible. Despite numerous leaks, the official names and specifications of these GPUs may differ from current reports. With the RTX 40 series production winding down and CES 2025 approaching, Nvidia is anticipated to announce its new graphics card lineup soon, but official details are still pending.",

        "content": "NEW YORK :An index of global stocks edged higher in choppy trading on Thursday as markets digested lackluster revenue forecasts from artificial-intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, while oil prices climbed amid rising tension from the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the world's most valuable company and a major contributor to the gains this year in the benchmark S&P 500, hit a record high early in the session before reversing direction and declining about 1 per cent. The chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters on Wednesday.\n\n\"(Nvidia's) results are still good but I think the disappointment came from maybe not quite as much of an upward guide on the Q4 number for the top line,\" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were lifted by energy, industrials and consumer staples stocks. Communication services stocks were the biggest drag on the Nasdaq, driven by losses in Alphabet, which is down about 6 per cent. U.S. prosecutors argued on Wednesday that Alphabet must divest its popular Chrome browser to end Google's search monopoly.\n\nThe Dow rose 0.84 per cent to 43,774.53, the S&P 500 gained 0.24 per cent to 5,931.60 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.40 per cent to 18,890.59.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.14 per cent to 849 after losing ground early in the session. European shares were up 0.37 per cent.\n\n\"The market seems to be looking for a narrative right now and is in a little bit of a void for any news that can shape the direction of things,\" Melson added.\n\nBitcoin soared and is closing in on the $100,000 milestone. The world's largest cryptocurrency has benefited from expectations that the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will be crypto-friendly. Bitcoin gained 2.52 per cent to $96,818.00. Ethereum rose 7.33 per cent to $3,306.40.\n\nMarkets are also eyeing Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, who will play a key role in implementing his agenda of tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nThe dollar rose in choppy trading as investors assessed declining weekly jobless claims, suggesting labor-market strength, and comments from two Federal Reserve governors on the path of interest rates.\n\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.63 per cent to 154.45 but it strengthened 0.15 per cent to 0.885 against the Swiss franc.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro,rose 0.22 per cent to 106.84, with the euro down 0.42 per cent at $1.05.\n\nOil prices rose more than 1 per cent after Russia and Ukraine exchanged missiles, raising crude-supply concerns. Brent crude futures rose 1.72 per cent to $74.06. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rallied 1.86 per cent to $70.04.\n\nSpot gold rose, on track for the fourth-consecutive session of gains after hitting a more than one-week high. Spot gold rose 0.73 per cent to $2,669.18 an ounce. U.S. gold futures rose 0.61 per cent to $2,664.30 an ounce.",
        "summary": "Global stocks experienced slight gains amid volatile trading, influenced by Nvidia's modest revenue forecasts and rising oil prices due to Russia-Ukraine tensions. Nvidia's shares initially hit a record high but later fell by about 1% after predicting its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones were buoyed by energy, industrials, and consumer staples, while the Nasdaq was dragged down by losses in Alphabet, which faces legal pressure to divest its Chrome browser. Bitcoin surged towards the $100,000 mark, driven by expectations of a crypto-friendly stance from the incoming Trump administration, while the dollar rose amid labor market strength and Federal Reserve comments. Oil prices increased over 1% due to supply concerns, and gold prices continued to rise, marking a fourth consecutive session of gains.",

        "content": "Nvidia has become the world’s most valuable company on the back of AI chips, passing Microsoft and Apple along the way, and in today’s Q3 2025 earnings, the company suggested its record AI revenue and profits are only the beginning.\n\nWhile The Information recently reported that its new flagship Blackwell AI servers might have cooling issues, the company didn’t address that on today’s call — instead, Nvidia assured investors that Blackwell is in “full production,” is “full steam” ahead, and that the company would continue to deliver more of the chips each quarter from here on out.\n\nNvidia has already shipped 13,000 Blackwell samples to its customers this quarter, said CFO Colette Kress, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed Blackwell’s success can already be measured in the billions as a result. “As you can see from all the systems being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape,” Huang told investors.\n\nWhile Nvidia has long been known as a graphics and gaming company, pioneering the GPU, its data center fortunes have now outstripped its other businesses by an order of magnitude. Gaming is now merely a $2–3 billion business each quarter for Nvidia, but its AI-infused data centers raked in $30.7 billion this past quarter, making up the vast majority of its $35 billion in quarterly earnings.\n\nMuch of that is pure profit for Nvidia, too: $14.8 billion in Q1; $16.6 billion in Q2; and now a profit of $19.3 billion in Q3. (Microsoft and Apple made $24.7 billion and $21.4 billion in profit, respectively, this past quarter, though.)\n\nPractically, that means there’s substantial overlap between each new generation of chips as businesses order them and stick them into data centers. Though Blackwell is Nvidia’s latest and greatest, Nvidia says today that the H200 it announced last year is actually now the fastest-selling product it’s ever made, growing to multiple billions of dollars’ worth this past quarter.\n\nNvidia’s H100 was its original winning AI product, though it took longer to see its current success; Huang says the company expects demand for its H-series chips to continue through most of next year.",

Despite reports of potential cooling issues with its new Blackwell AI servers, Nvidia assured investors that Blackwell is in full production and will continue to deliver more chips each quarter. Nvidia has shipped 13,000 Blackwell samples this quarter, and CEO Jensen Huang highlighted Blackwell's success in generating billions in revenue. While Nvidia was traditionally known for graphics and gaming, its AI-driven data centers now dominate its business, with $30.7 billion in revenue this past quarter compared to $2–3 billion from gaming. Nvidia's profits have grown significantly, with $19.3 billion in Q3, and its H200 chip, announced last year, is now its fastest-selling product, with continued demand expected for its H-series chips.",

        "content": "Most analysts on Nvidia’s earnings call focused their questions on the rollout of the AI chip leader’s next-generation Blackwell platform, as well as topics like the company’s margins and supply chain. But there are massive Donald Trump–size questions hanging over the semiconductor industry, and CEO Jensen Huang did field one inquiry about what the President-elect’s return to the Oval Office could mean for the business.\n\nTrump’s calls for worldwide tariffs would presumably affect Nvidia. Despite his general tough-on-China rhetoric, previous comments casting doubt on America’s commitment to help Taiwan defend itself against a potential Chinese invasion have weighed on chip stocks. Taiwan is the home of Nvidia’s preeminent supplier, TSMC.\n\n“The unpredictability of the president-elect is now an overhang on basically all of tech,” said Ted Mortonson, a managing director and tech desk sector strategist at Baird.\n\nWhatever a second Trump administration decides to do, Huang said, Nvidia will be on board.\n\n“That’s our highest mandate,” he said. “We will comply fully with any regulation that comes along.”\n\nNvidia, as well as other chipmakers, has struggled to make chips for the Chinese market to meet export controls from the Biden administration, which is also reportedly weighing additional measures on sales to wealthy nations in the Persian Gulf.\n\nSales to China, once making up a quarter of the company’s revenue, accounted for just 12% of business last quarter, per Bloomberg. Angelo Zino of CFRA Research said there’s a possibility a more transactional approach from the Trump administration regarding China, compared with the current’s administration blanket bans, could potentially benefit the world’s largest company.\n\nChina, he said in a recent note, is currently a generation or two behind when it comes to AI chip development.\n\n“According to our Washington Analysis team, Trump may be willing to offer more advanced AI chips to other nations, even China, if the price is right while maintaining a certain technology lead,” he wrote.\n\nStill, Trump’s proposed universal tariff could pose challenges, given that 57% of Nvidia’s business is done abroad, according to Bloomberg. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress touted momentum in demand for so-called sovereign AI, or nations investing in their own gen AI infrastructure, saying deployment of GPUs in India has grown 10-fold.\n\nCFRA believes sovereign AI could account for $11 billion to $12 billion in revenue this year. Nonetheless, no matter who’s in the White House, Nvidia’s importance to the U.S. as a national security asset looms large.\n\n“There is a worry that now this is a national defense company,” Mortonson said.\n\nAmid many unknowns, it’s obvious Huang and his company must navigate much more than meeting ravenous demand.",
        "summary": "Nvidia's earnings call highlighted concerns about the potential impact of Donald Trump's return to the presidency on the semiconductor industry, particularly regarding tariffs and relations with China. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized Nvidia's commitment to complying with any new regulations, despite the unpredictability surrounding Trump's policies. The company has faced challenges in meeting export controls to China, which has significantly reduced its revenue from the Chinese market. Analysts suggest that a more transactional approach from Trump could benefit Nvidia, but proposed universal tariffs could pose challenges given the company's significant international business. Nvidia's role as a national security asset is increasingly important, and the company must navigate these uncertainties while addressing growing demand for AI technology.",

        "content": "Accelerated computing is enabling giant leaps in performance and energy efficiency compared to traditional CPU computing. Delivering these advancements requires full-stack innovation at data-center scale, spanning chips, systems, networking, software, and algorithms. Choosing the right architecture for the right workload with the best energy efficiency is critical to maximizing the performance and minimizing the carbon footprint of your data center.\n\nAlthough workloads are increasingly accelerated by GPUs, many use cases continue to run primarily on traditional CPUs—particularly code that is sparse and “branchy” serialized tasks such as graph analytics. At the same time, data centers are increasingly power-constrained, limiting the growth of their capabilities. This means that all workloads that can be accelerated should run accelerated. Those that have not been accelerated should run on the most efficient CPU compute possible.\n\nThe NVIDIA Grace CPU combines 72 high-performance and power-efficient Arm Neoverse V2 cores, connected with the NVIDIA Scalable Coherency Fabric (SCF) that delivers 3.2 TB/s of bisection bandwidth—double that of traditional CPUs. This architecture keeps data flowing between CPU cores, cache, memory, and system I/O to get the most out of the system performance. Grace is the first data center CPU to utilize server-class high-speed LPDDR5X memory with a wide memory subsystem that delivers 500 GB/s of bandwidth at one-fifth the power of traditional DDR memory at a similar cost.\n\nFigure 1. NVIDIA Grace Superchip (left) and Grace Hopper Superchip (right)\n\nThe NVIDIA Grace CPU powers multiple NVIDIA products. It can pair with either NVIDIA Hopper or NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs to form a new type of processor that tightly couples the CPU and GPU to supercharge generative AI, high-performance computing (HPC) and accelerated computing. In addition, the NVIDIA Grace CPU portfolio includes both the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip that is the heart of a dual-socket server and the Grace CPU C1 that delivers incredible performance in a single socket configuration.\n\nThe NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip brings together the groundbreaking performance of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU with the versatility of the NVIDIA Grace CPU in a single superchip, connected with the high-bandwidth, memory-coherent 900 GB/s NVIDIA NVLink Chip-2-Chip (C2C) interconnect that delivers 7x the bandwidth of the PCIe Gen 5. NVLink-C2C memory coherency increases developer productivity, performance, and the amount of GPU-accessible memory. CPU and GPU threads can concurrently and transparently access both CPU and GPU resident memory, enabling you to focus on algorithms instead of explicit memory management.\n\nOver the last two decades, computer-aided engineering (CAE) has been revolutionizing product development. The ability to quickly assess the physical performance of a design virtually without having to create a physical prototype has saved time and money. The adoption of CAE has been key for many sectors, including the automotive industry where it has helped them succeed in a competitive market and has allowed them to quickly adapt to industry trends like electrification.\n\nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crash workloads are highly networking performance-driven simulations requiring maximum bandwidth, ultra-low latency, and native CPU offloads, such as RDMA, to achieve optimal server efficiency and application productivity for multinode scalability. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand meets these demands by providing ultrafast data speeds, minimal latency, intelligent accelerations, and superior efficiency, enabling exceptional scalability and performance.\n\nAnsys is the leading provider of CAE tools. This post explores the performance of Ansys LS-DYNA, which is commonly used for crash analysis, and Ansys Fluent software, which is commonly used for CFD aerodynamics analysis. Ansys LS-DYNA simulation is primarily a CPU workload, so will be tested on NVIDIA Grace CPU. Ansys Fluent software benefits from a native CUDA solver, so will be run on NVIDIA Grace Hopper. These workloads are key in the automotive industry. Crash analysis often occupies over 50% of the automotive HPC workload, with CFD being the largest of the remaining workloads.\n\nCAE revolutionizes automotive crash analysis\n\nEnsuring a vehicle meets safety requirements without excess weight is essential to ensure a safe and energy-efficient vehicle. The industry standard tool for crash analysis is Ansys LS-DYNA software. Due to the nature of the explicit nonlinear solver required, this workload runs on CPU. Given that there are many thousands of CPU cores running crash analysis at just one OEM, there’s good potential for energy and cost savings by adopting the NVIDIA Grace CPU.\n\nFigure 2. Odm benchmark crash simulation models for Ansys LS-DYNA software\n\nFigure 3. ar2car benchmark crash simulation models for Ansys LS-DYNA\n\nA key element in adopting any new hardware platform is having an ecosystem of software. As Grace is based on the Arm architecture, there is a rich and growing ecosystem of support. This includes many of the tools offered by Ansys, such as LS-DYNA software.\n\nPerformance of Ansys LS-DYNA on NVIDIA Grace CPU\n\nFigure 4 shows NVIDIA Grace CPU performance compared to other currently available x86 options for both the car2car_20m and odm_10m models. The relative performance measurement is based on the CPU time to complete the case.\n\nFigure 4. Performance of the NVIDIA Grace CPU in comparison to many of the standard x86 options\n\nFigure 5 shows the advantage of the NVIDIA Grace Superchip in energy efficiency. Grace can run both the car2car_20m and odm_10m cases with far less power resulting in reduced cost and more sustainable compute. Many data centers are power limited, so reduced power consumption results in more compute within the same power budget.\n\nFigure 5. The NVIDIA Grace CPU provides superior energy efficiency compared to a range of x86 architectures\n\nAs LS-DYNA simulations are often run across several nodes to reduce the runtime and get engineering analysis information faster, we compared a scaling of 1-8 nodes of Grace CPU versus 1-8 nodes of Intel Sapphire Rapids.\n\nFigure 6. Multinode scaling of the ODM_10m model from 1-8 nodes for NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Intel Xeon Platinum 8480+\n\nFigure 7. Multinode scaling of the car2car_20m model from 1-8 nodes for NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Intel Xeon Platinum 8480+\n\nNVIDIA Grace Superchip 480GB of LPDDR5X, AMD EPYC 9654 768 GB of DDR5 and Intel Xeon Platinum 8480+ with 1TB DDR5. OS: CentOS 7.9 (Grace) Ubuntu 22..04 (x86) Compilers: LLVM 12.0.1 (Grace), Intel FORTRAN Compiler 19.0 (x86). LS-DYNA R14.1.\n\nEnergy-efficient compute for Ansys LS-DYNA simulations\n\nThe NVIDIA Grace CPU is a step forward in energy efficiency for workloads like automotive crash analysis with Ansys LS-DYNA software. Arm-based architectures, like Grace, offer a compelling balance of performance and efficiency, a trend that’s increasingly relevant for HPC, where power costs can be substantial. The benchmark results of over 2x performance/watt improvement over x86 alternatives underscore how Arm is becoming a viable HPC option. In a power-capped data center, that means that you can get up to twice the performance in the same power envelope, which expands simulation capabilities. Customers could maintain the same level of performance while freeing additional resources for acceleration. With the upcoming NVIDIA Vera CPU, Arm’s role in HPC is set to expand even further, likely enhancing both raw performance and efficiency.\n\nNext-generation compute for Ansys Fluent simulation\n\nDesigning an efficient vehicle requires an understanding of aerodynamic performance. The drag of a vehicle directly influences the range. Therefore, many simulations need to be run to optimize the shape of the vehicle. These simulations are computationally expensive given the wide range of time and length scales that need to be captured. Running CFD tools like Ansys Fluent software quickly and efficiently is key.\n\nFigure 8. An Ansys Fluent 2024 R2 simulation of the 2.5-billion Cell DrivAer dataset shows the small-scale flow features captured by a simulation of this fidelity\n\nAnsys ran Fluent 2024 R2 software on the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) Vista supercomputer with 320 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, all connected with the NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gb/s InfiniBand networking to enable scalable performance. The large, 2.4-billion cell automotive simulation would have taken nearly a month on 2,048 x86 CPU cores, but on Grace Hopper it ran 110x faster and was completed in just over 6 hours.\n\nFigure 9. Ansys Fluent 2024 R2 simulation software running at TACC on Grace Hopper scaling to 320 GPUs for a 2.5 billion Cell DrivAer dataset\n\nIn addition to speed, energy and cost efficiencies are serious concerns. Ansys Fluent simulation on Grace Hopper also excels when evaluated for these metrics.\n\nFigure 10 shows the number of DrivAer 2.4B simulations run for 1,000 iterations per kilowatt-hour in comparison to the same simulation on 2,048 cores of an x86 CPU. Though the Grace Hopper system uses more power, it finishes the simulation much faster, so it saves over six times the energy used by CPUs. To contextualize this, the average U.S. household uses 30 kWh per day. For that amount of energy, Grace Hopper could run a simulation of this size nine times. The CPU system could only run it 1.5 times.\n\nFigure 10. The chart shows the number of DrivAer 2.4B simulations that can be run per kilowatt-hour\n\nFrom a price performance standpoint, we completed a similar analysis but used standard pricing for the CPU server and Grace Hopper servers. With a useful life of 3 years for a supercomputer, we saw a 4x advantage to using Grace Hopper for large Ansys Fluent simulations such as the one presented in this post.\n\nWe calculated the number of simulations that could be done per dollar by calculating the number of 1,000 iteration simulations of DrivAer 2.4B that could be done in 3 years divided by the cost of 2,048 cores or 32 GPUs.\n\nFigure 11.

The Russell 2000 Index, viewed as a barometer for small companies and beneficiary of a possible boost to the economy from President-elect Donald Trump, added more than 1%.\n\nInvestors assessed results for artificial intelligence chip juggernaut Nvidia , which was up more than 190% this year into the results. Shares seesawed after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and issued strong guidance. Some traders attributed earlier declines in the stock to slowing revenue growth from previous quarters, or concerns that the chipmaker didn't exceed the most optimistic guidance estimate. Shares ultimately ended the session higher by 0.5%.",

        "content": "Tech juggernaut has surpassed Wall Street expectations for 25 of the past 26 quarters.\n\nThe logo of Nvidia at its corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., in May 2022.\n\nThe logo of Nvidia at its corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., in May 2022. Courtesy of NVIDIA/Handout via Reuters\n\nNvidia shares dropped by as much as 4 percent in after-hours trading even after the tech juggernaut again beat Wall Street estimates. The $3.5 trillion chipmaker enters its third year of being on top of the artificial intelligence wave.\n\nNvidia’s revenues came in at a record $35.08 billion in the third quarter, higher than the market forecast of $33.16 billion. Nvidia has beaten Wall Street’s revenue and guidance forecasts in 25 of the past 26 quarters.\n\nData center revenues totaled $30.8 billion, topping projections of $29.14 billion. Gaming revenues came in at $3.3 billion, slightly higher than the forecast of $3.06 billion.\n\nThe California-based company reported earnings per share of 81 cents, beating the expected 75 cents.\n\nNet income reached an all-time high of $19.3 billion in the previous quarter, up by 109 percent year over year.\n\nIt kept its quarterly dividend unchanged at 1 cent per share.\n\nWhile the third-quarter results were crucial for the financial markets, investors also wanted to see how the company expects the fourth quarter to unfold.\n\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress expects growth to be solid, telling analysts on an earnings call that the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimates will exceed previous projections by several billion dollars because of persistent demand for its Blackwell chips and Hopper graphics processing units (GPU).\n\nBlackwell next-generation chips are designed for data centers and have been shipping to other tech titans, including Google, Microsoft, and Oracle.\n\nAccording to Nvidia’s latest earnings report, Blackwell production shipments will start in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 and “staggering” demand will exceed supply for several quarters.\n\n“Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us,” Kress told analysts and shareholders. “Customers are gearing to deploy Blackwell at scale.”\n\nCurrent quarterly sales are forecast to be $37.5 billion, higher than analysts’ expectations of $37.08 billion.\n\nNvidia executives pointed to the company’s growing list of partners, including Dell, Foxconn, Micron, and Vertiv. They also referenced Super Micro Computer, a server maker facing an accounting saga, as another company with which it maintains a strong relationship.\n\nLooking to foreign markets, Kress noted that Nvidia has witnessed increasing data center sales to China, as Hopper GPUs comply with U.S. export rules.\n\n“We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward,” she said.\n\nThe company has been at the center of the artificial intelligence boom over the past two years, and analysts and traders believe that Nvidia’s next-generation chip will sustain its growth.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to [Nvidia] computing,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell—in full production—are incredible, as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference.”\n\nOver the past week, there have been complaints that the new AI chip is overheating when connected to customized server racks. Nvidia said it is remedying the problem by working with suppliers to alter the rack designs to reduce overheating issues.\n\nDavid Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, shrugged off the reports and called it a “non-issue.”\n\n“Blackwell chip overheating should be a non-issue as the ramping for Blackwell will be primarily in the January quarter and data centers will adjust their configuration to accommodate the issue given. There is no alternative to Nvidia chips,” Miller said in a note emailed to The Epoch Times.\n\nThe stock plunged by more than 4 percent immediately after the third-quarter earnings data. Shares of Nvidia stabilized throughout the call and were down about 1.4 percent.\n\nNvidia shares have rocketed by 200 percent since the beginning of 2024, reaching $145 before the latest earnings report.\n\nThe market still sees an upside to Nvidia shares.\n\nThe consensus price target is close to $155 by December 2025, representing a more than 6 percent upside from the current price. The stock also maintains an overwhelming “buy” rating.\n\nWedbush Securities projects that Nvidia shares will “outperform,” giving it a 7.5 percent upside to about $160.\n\nMiller maintains a price target of $185 for Nvidia stock by the end of next year. Raymond James analysts were even more bullish, boosting its price target to $170, representing a 16 percent upside.\n\n“There is no alternative to Nvidia aside from newer Nvidia chips, so they should continue to be the major beneficiary of AI, [capital expenditure] increasing rapidly,” he said.\n\nAccording to a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report , the global artificial intelligence market’s impact on the global economy could reach $15.7 trillion by 2030.\n\nMore than $9 trillion could come from consumption-side effects, and $6.6 trillion could arise from enhanced productivity.",
        "summary": "Nvidia has consistently surpassed Wall Street expectations, beating revenue and guidance forecasts in 25 of the past 26 quarters, with its latest third-quarter revenue reaching a record $35.08 billion.

        "content": "Nvidia posts another strong earnings beat as customers race to deploy next-gen Blackwell GPUs\nUpdated with Thursday stock price:\nArtificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia Corp. delivered a better-than-expected earnings and revenue beat as it posted its hotly anticipated third-quarter financial results.\nIt also offered guidance for the coming quarter that was higher than expectations, yet its stock fell almost 2% in extended trading. Update: After sleeping on it, investors decided they liked what they saw, bidding shares up almost 1% Thursday — and raising the Dow by 462 points.\nThe company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 81 cents per share, beating Wall Street’s projection of 75 cents. Revenue for the period rose 94% year-over-year, to $35.08 billion, ahead of the $33.16 billion analyst target.\nThe numbers show Nvidia is continuing to grow rapidly on rampant enterprise demand for its AI processors, though investors will have noted that its revenue growth slowed in comparison to the previous three quarters, when sales rose by 122%, 262% and 265%.\nEven so, the profits kept pouring into the company. Net income rose to $19.3 billion in the quarter, up from just $9.24 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia said it’s expecting to see revenue of around $37.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, just above the analysts’ consensus estimate of $37.08 billion. That forecast implies year-over-year revenue growth of about 70% from the previous year, slowing from annual growth of 265% in the year-ago quarter.\nAI drives demand\nNvidia’s rampant sales have been driven by incredible demand from cloud infrastructure providers and other enterprises for its iconic graphics processing units, which power the vast majority of AI workloads today. The company has been the single largest beneficiary of the technology industry’s race to embrace AI, and it has emerged to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company.\nMost of the growth stems from Nvidia’s data center business, which covers sales from AI chips and related components and makes up the lion’s share of its revenue. The company attributed $30.8 billion of its sales to that segment, up 112% from a year earlier, beating the Street’s forecast of $28.82 billion.\nNot all of those sales were GPUs, though. The company said around $3.1 billion of revenue attributed to the business comes from the sale of networking components such as its InfiniBand products.\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” said Nvidia founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang (pictured).\nNvidia also reported a gross margin of 73.5%, just above the Street’s estimates, which was attributed to the sale of increasing numbers of data center chips.\nThird Bridge analyst Lucas Keh said Nvidia’s data center unit delivered sequential growth of 17% during the quarter, and he expects the company to be able to maintain that rate for some time to come. “Our experts believe this growth rate could continue throughout 2025 as cloud providers increase their appetite for data center GPUs,” he said.\nElsewhere in Nvidia’ business, sales of GPUs for gaming delivered $3.28 billion in revenue, beating the Street’s forecast of $3.03 billion. According to the company, this was the result of increased demand for high-powered GPUs in personal computers and laptops, plus rising console-related revenue.\nThe much smaller automotive and professional visualization businesses also posted strong results. Sales in the former rose 72%, to $449 million, while in the latter, they increased 17%, to $486 million.\nHolger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. noted that Nvidia’s quarterly net income of $19.3 billion is more than it generated in the first nine months of the previous fiscal year. “That is unheard-of growth and acceleration for such an established company,” he pointed out.\nFirst Blackwell chips shipped\nAnalysts were also looking for Nvidia’s guidance for its next-generation Blackwell GPUs, which promise to deliver a 30-times performance boost versus the existing H100 chips while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% on some workloads. The company had initially planned to ship the Blackwell chips in the second half of this year, but its plans came unstuck when a design flaw was revealed, causing the launch date to be pushed back to early 2025.\nEarlier this week, reports emerged that claimed Blackwell might be subject to further delays from supposed overheating problems when testing clusters of multiple chips linked together in data center server racks, though the company played down such fears.\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Collette Kress shrugged off the report in a conference call with analysts, saying the company intends to expand production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter and accelerate production through fiscal 2026.\nShe added that most customers, including the likes of Microsoft Corp., OpenAI and Oracle Corp., have already started receiving samples of the Blackwell GPUs, with 13,000 shipped out so far. “Every customer is racing to be the first to market,” Kress said. “Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.”\nKeh said it was interesting to note that the concentration of revenue attributed to public cloud providers increased on a sequential basis during the quarter. “This points to positive signs of hyperscale adoption for Blackwell, despite the delays,” he explained.\nAccording to Kress, Blackwell shipments are expected to ramp up significantly in the next year, and she thinks the company is on track to generate “several billion dollars” of revenue in the fourth quarter. She added that sales of the current-generation H200 chip also increased substantially in the quarter. The company recently announced the launch of a new and improved version of the H200 GPUs, called the H200 NVL, which provides a 1.5-times memory efficiency increase and 1.2-times bandwidth increase over the H100 NVL.\n“Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026,” Kress added.\nMueller said the guidance indicates that Huang and his team have a good grip on the all-important supply chain side of the business, and that should ensure that delivering to expectations in the current quarter is a relatively easy exercise.\nKeh said there are indications that Nvidia’s pricing strategy for Blackwell won’t be as aggressive as analysts had previously thought. He said the sequential decline in data center GPU margins was because customers are shifting from older H100 systems to more complex systems such as the H200 and the Blackwell-based B200 chips.\n“If the transition to these GPUs is negatively impacting Nvidia’s margins, this confirms Blackwell pricing will not be as aggressive initially, likely to spur adoption against competitive threats like AMD,” he pointed out.\nPhoto: Robert Hof/SiliconANGLE\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Nvidia’s third quarter results came in better than expected as the company beat the already soaring expectations placed at its feet, according to a highly anticipated earnings call.\n\nRevenues for the quarter were $35.1 billion, up 94% from a year ago and a 17% increase from the previous quarter. Profits were $19.3 billion, an increase of 109% from the same time last year. Gross margins dipped slightly to 74.6% this quarter from 75.1% in the second quarter. Even that, though, was better than expected. UBS had forecasted a 200 basis point reduction in gross margin, according to analyst note from earlier this month.\n\nGAAP earnings per share were up 111% compared to last year for $0.78 a share.\n\n“Explosive earnings again,” said Alonso Munoz, chief investment officer of Hamilton Capital Partners.\n\nThe stock market darling and prime beneficiary of the AI boom was expected to deliver another stand-out quarter. Anything less would have disappointed the markets. Nvidia beat expectations on all fronts outperforming analyst forecasts on growth. The prime concern for the stock, which has been on a meteoric 200% rise since the start of the year, remains whether it can continue to grow at the pace it has so far. The $35.1 billion in revenue topped expectations that were meant to be somewhere in the $34 billion to $35 billion range.\n\nThe bulk of Nvidia’s revenue comes from its data center business that encompasses sales of the components used to power AI products. Revenue for that division was $30.8 billion, higher than the roughly $28 billion some had expected.\n\nThe lead-up to the earnings call did feature some amount of trepidation. The stock fell 1% on Wednesday before the earnings report, set to be released after market close. Shares fell 2% in after-hours trading. The moves in the stock were expected, as investors sought to harvest gains by selling at what they believed to be the peak. Investors that continue to hold the stock have to grit their teeth and believe in the company’s continued growth trajectory, which it showed yet again. “We’re sanguine about the fact that we expected this,” Munoz said.\n\nOn the call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed the demand for its new Blackwell chips. Huang said the company was delivering more Blackwell chips this quarter than expected. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said. Investors had previously questioned whether there were production delays in the new chip.\n\nConcerns were further heightened this week when the tech publication The Information reported that Blackwell was overheating in certain data center racks. Nvidia said it was “normal and expected” that certain customers had to change the configuration of its data center racks.\n\nPerhaps the one lingering concern is that the immediate rollout of Blackwell should see a slight drop in gross margin toward the low-70s, Nvidia chief financial officer Collette Kress said on the call. She added that drop was expected to be temporary. “We will start growing into our gross margins,” Kress said.",
        "summary": "Nvidia's third-quarter results exceeded expectations, with revenues reaching $35.1 billion, a 94% increase from the previous year, and profits rising by 109% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins slightly decreased to 74.6%, but this was still better than anticipated, as analysts had predicted a larger decline. Nvidia's data center business, which supports AI products, was a significant contributor to its revenue, generating $30.8 billion. Despite some investor concerns and a slight drop in stock prices before and after the earnings report, Nvidia's growth trajectory remains strong, driven by the demand for its new Blackwell chips. The company acknowledged potential short-term impacts on gross margins due to the Blackwell rollout but expects these to be temporary.",

        "content": "Nvidia has once again turned out quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street’s forecasts\n\nNvidia is Wall Street's most valuable company. How it got there, by the numbers\n\nNvidia has once again turned out quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts. The company has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications.\n\nRevenue nearly doubled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, Nvidia reported Wednesday. The company expects further revenue growth in the current quarter that ends in January. Investors will be watching to see if demand for the company's next-generation AI chip called Blackwell can help it maintain the red-hot pace.\n\nThe company’s journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look.\n\nNvidia’s total market value as of the close Wednesday, tops in the S & P 500. It regained the No. 1 sport from Apple ($3.461 trillion) earlier this week. Microsoft is the only other company with a market value above $3 trillion ($3.089 trillion). One year ago, Nvidia's market value was around $1.243 trillion.\n\nGain in Nvidia's stock price so far this year as of the close of trading Wednesday. A $100,000 investment in Nvidia two years ago would now be worth more than $950,000. Shares fell about 1% in after-hours trading following the release of the company's earnings.\n\nThat's how much of the S & P 500's gain for the year could be attributed to Nvidia alone, as of Oct. 31. Nvidia replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this month.\n\nNvidia's revenue from its data center business for the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 112% from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 94% from a year ago to $35.1 billion. By comparison, revenue growth for all the companies in the S & P 500 is expected to be about 5.5% for the latest quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nNvidia's estimate for overall revenue in the fourth quarter, “plus or minus 2%.” That translates to a range of $36.8 billion to $38.3 billion, compared to Wall Street's estimate of $37.1 billion. Revenue in the year-ago fourth quarter totaled $22.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts’ estimate for Nvidia’s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That would be more than double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\nThe number of Thanksgiving meals one could buy with Nvidia's market value of $3.579 trillion, using the $65.51 estimated cost of a 15-item meal from retail intelligence provider Datasembly.",

        "content": "Nvidia has once again turned out quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street’s forecasts\n\nNvidia is Wall Street's most valuable company. How it got there, by the numbers\n\nNvidia has once again turned out quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts. The company has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications.\n\nRevenue nearly doubled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, Nvidia reported Wednesday. The company expects further revenue growth in the current quarter that ends in January. Investors will be watching to see if demand for the company's next-generation AI chip called Blackwell can help it maintain the red-hot pace.\n\nThe company’s journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look.\n\nNvidia’s total market value as of the close Wednesday, tops in the S & P 500. It regained the No. 1 sport from Apple ($3.461 trillion) earlier this week. Microsoft is the only other company with a market value above $3 trillion ($3.089 trillion). One year ago, Nvidia's market value was around $1.243 trillion.\n\nGain in Nvidia's stock price so far this year as of the close of trading Wednesday. A $100,000 investment in Nvidia two years ago would now be worth more than $950,000. Shares fell about 1% in after-hours trading following the release of the company's earnings.\n\nThat's how much of the S & P 500's gain for the year could be attributed to Nvidia alone, as of Oct. 31. Nvidia replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this month.\n\nNvidia's revenue from its data center business for the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 112% from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 94% from a year ago to $35.1 billion. By comparison, revenue growth for all the companies in the S & P 500 is expected to be about 5.5% for the latest quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nNvidia's estimate for overall revenue in the fourth quarter, “plus or minus 2%.” That translates to a range of $36.8 billion to $38.3 billion, compared to Wall Street's estimate of $37.1 billion. Revenue in the year-ago fourth quarter totaled $22.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts’ estimate for Nvidia’s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That would be more than double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\nThe number of Thanksgiving meals one could buy with Nvidia's market value of $3.579 trillion, using the $65.51 estimated cost of a 15-item meal from retail intelligence provider Datasembly.",
        "summary": "Nvidia has reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by high demand for its semiconductors used in artificial intelligence applications.

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney, Arsheeya Bajwa and Stephen Nellis\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters on Wednesday, with the artificial intelligence chipmaker failing to meet lofty expectations of some investors who have made it the world's most valuable firm.\n\nShares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell 5% after it posted results but quickly pared losses to trade down 2.5% after hours. During the regular session they closed 0.8% lower. In early Frankfurt trade on Thursday they were down 1.9%.\n\nExpectations ran high ahead of the results, with Nvidia shares up more than 20% over the last two months and hitting an intraday record high on Monday. The stock has nearly tripled so far this year and is up more than ninefold over the last two years, giving it a market value of $3.6 trillion.\n\nNvidia is in the middle of launching its powerful Blackwell family of AI chips, which will weigh on the company's gross margins initially but improve over time.\n\nThe new line of processors has been embraced by Nvidia's customers and the company will exceed its initial projections of several billion dollars in sales of the processors in the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday.\n\nAsked about media reports that a flagship liquid-cooled server containing 72 of the new chips was experiencing overheating issues during initial testing, CEO Jensen Huang said there are no issues and customers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Oracle (NYSE: ) and CoreWeave are implementing the systems.\n\n\"There are no issues with our Grace Blackwell liquid-cooled systems,\" Huang told Reuters. \"The engineering is not easy at all, because what we're doing is hard, but we're in good shape.\"\n\nInitially its Blackwell family of chips will carry gross margins in the low 70% range, but will increase to the mid-70% range when production ramps up, Kress said.\n\nThe company forecast revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% for the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $37.09 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nWhile still a stunning rate of growth thanks to huge demand for the company's chips that make up the brains of complex generative AI systems, it marks a clear slowdown from previous quarters when Nvidia mostly posted sales that at least doubled.\n\nNvidia's fourth-quarter forecast indicated the company's revenue growth will slow to roughly 69.5% from 94% in the third-quarter.\n\n\"Investors have become accustomed to huge beats from this company, but doing that is getting harder and harder,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. \"This was still a very solid report, but the truth is when the bar is this high it makes things just that much tougher.\"\n\nThe slowdown in revenue growth, however, obfuscates enormous demand for the company's AI chips, which dominate the market.\n\nSupply chain snags have made it harder for Nvidia to report the big beats on revenue that have helped make it a Wall Street darling. But growth could pick up again if the company's margins exceed 75%, said IDC analyst Brandon Hoff.\n\nOne of the bottlenecks for its chip supply has been the limited capacity for advanced manufacturing techniques at the company's fabrication partner TSMC.\n\nHuang declined to comment on specific production issues with TSMC but also told Reuters that \"as we ramp (Blackwell) up, we'll keep increasing more production lines, and we'll keep improving our yield, and we improve our cycle time. All of that would improve our outputs.\"\n\nThe yield refers to the number of working chips per wafer. The company said it had fixed a design flaw with its Blackwell chips by changing the blueprints used by TSMC to manufacture it.\n\nTSMC shares were down about 1% in early Asian trading on Thursday.\n\nNvidia recorded third-quarter adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, compared with estimates of 75 cents per share.\n\nSales in the data center segment, which accounts for a majority of Nvidia's revenue, grew 112% to $30.77 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 27. The segment had recorded growth of 154% in the prior quarter.\n\nNvidia's sales are boosted by cloud companies' continued spending on its chips, as they expand data centers capable of handling generative AI's complex processing needs.\n\nThe company said adjusted gross margin shrank to 75%.\n\n(This story has been corrected to say that the stock nearly tripled in value this year, not quadrupled, in paragraph 3 )",

        "content": "The lead-up to Nvidia’s Wednesday’s earnings release produced plenty of jitters on Wall Street, despite expectations of incredible growth. The Q3 results, put out after the bell, did not prompt the massive selloff some feared, with the AI chip leader’s stock dropping less than 2% in after-hours trading as management spoke to analysts on the call.\n\nLast quarter, a modest revenue and earnings beat was not enough to prevent a massive sell-the-news event, with the stock falling 18% in the week following the call. Some figured the stock could be due for another dip this time around with institutional investors eager to engage in profit-taking at the end the year.\n\nThe stock held steady early Wednesday evening, however, as revenue jumped 94% year over year to $35.1 billion. The company’s January guidance also came in better than expected, with the chipmaker indicating it is confident about the rollout of its next-generation Blackwell platform.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Huang said in a press release. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell—in full production—are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference.”\n\nWhen it comes to the stock’s short-term movement, investors might not be totally out of woods yet. Options trading ahead of the call implied a move just short of 8% in either direction, according to Bloomberg. That would roughly equate to a $300 billion swing in market value, bigger than the valuations of all but 24 of America’s largest companies.\n\nRegardless, shareholders have been massively rewarded, particularly if they bought before or around the release of ChatGPT in 2022 and subsequent gen AI boom. The stock has appreciated 800% over the past two years, with Nvidia adding more than $3 trillion in market cap to trade places with Apple as the world’s largest company.\n\nDespite Nvidia’s growth running up against the law of large numbers, Wall Street appears optimistic about the stock’s continuing to reward investors. As of Wednesday afternoon, roughly 90% of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg (or 68 out of 76) had a buy rating on the stock, compared with 8% placing a hold and under 3% advising to sell.\n\nBased on recent earnings and the Street’s expectations, the stock is not incredibly expensive, either. Before the earnings call, the company’s blended price to earnings ratio sat just north of 36, per Bloomberg. That represented just a 24% premium to the semiconductor industry.\n\nBesides the gen AI trade, semis have struggled mightily, Baird managing director Ted Mortonson told Fortune before the call, amid a contraction in autos and flagging industrial demand in Europe. The PHLX Semiconductor Index, commonly known as SOX, is down about 8% year to date.\n\n“Nvidia has just been holding up the index,” said Mortonson, who is also a tech desk sector strategist.\n\nOn Wednesday, the world’s hottest company continued to deliver.",
        "summary": "Nvidia's Q3 earnings report showed a 94% year-over-year revenue increase to $35.1 billion, with better-than-expected guidance for January, which helped stabilize its stock despite initial Wall Street jitters. The company's stock dropped less than 2% in after-hours trading, avoiding the massive selloff seen in the previous quarter. Nvidia's growth is driven by strong demand for its AI chips, particularly the Hopper and upcoming Blackwell platforms, as the AI industry continues to expand. Despite potential short-term volatility, Nvidia's stock has appreciated 800% over the past two years, making it the world's largest company by market cap, surpassing Apple. Analysts remain optimistic, with 90% recommending a buy, and the stock's price-to-earnings ratio is considered reasonable compared to the semiconductor industry.",

        "content": "Nvidia has reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust.\n\nFor the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago.\n\nNvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year’s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.\n\nWall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nInvestors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia’s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.\n\nNvidia’s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.\n\nAnalysts’ were eyeing Nvidia’s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers.\n\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.\n\nOn an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems “have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.”\n\n“Every customer is racing to be the first to market,” Kress said. “Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.”\n\nThe company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver “more Blackwells than we had previously estimated” this quarter, Huang added.\n\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\n\nThe company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang’s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia’s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company's third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.\n\nNvidia's fourth-quarter guidance was “a little bit disappointing,” said David Volpe, senior fund manager at Emerald Insights Fund, but the company still had “a tremendous quarter.\"\n\n“There’s nothing touching it in terms of the growth,” Volpe said.\n\nDemand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia's path to $4 trillion.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the earnings report shows “the AI Revolution is still in the early innings of playing out.”\n\n“We view this as a Nvidia earnings press release that should be hung in the Louvre,” Ives said. “Blackwell demand is just beginning. Any sell off (in Nvidia's stock) we would view as short lived, with our view this is a $4 trillion market cap in 2025 as the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) drives this spending wave.”\n\nThrough the year’s first six months, Nvidia’s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company’s earnings over the prior 12 months. That’s much more expensive than it’s been historically and than the S & P 500 in general.\n\n“The age of AI is upon us,\" Huang said on the call. \"And it’s large and diverse.”",

        "content": "This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nChip designer NVIDIA Corporation delivered results mostly in line with analyst estimates for its third quarter, as it guided fourth quarter margins lower than the previous quarter's and shared that its Blackwell AI GPUs will continue to face supply constraints for most of the next fiscal year. NVIDIA's earnings report for its fiscal year 2025's third quarter saw the firm beat analyst revenue and earnings estimates.\n\nHeading into today's release, analysts were expecting NVIDIA to rake in $33 billion in revenue and $18.4 billion in net income. NVIDIA surpassed both of these by earning $35 billion in revenue and $20 billion in non-GAAP profit. Additionally, the firm also met analyst estimates for its gross margin, which sat at 75%, to remain flat annually and record a 70 basis point sequential drop.\n\nNVIDIA Shares Remain Muted Following Another Set Of Tepid Earnings Results Compared To Estimates\n\nNVIDIA's third-quarter results were identical to the second quarter's reports when it comes to the top and bottom line beat and the subsequent share price movement. After the firm posted its Q2 results, despite the fact that it had beaten analyst revenue, earnings and guidance estimates, its shares nevertheless slipped in aftermarket trading. This drop was attributed to weak margins, and with the third quarter results, a similar story is playing out.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA's post-third-quarter earnings share price drop is more muted. After its results were released, and even though the firm beat analyst estimates for major metrics, the shares dropped by 3.5% before paring back the loss to 1.33%. NVIDIA's gross margin of 75% for the quarter also met analyst estimates, but it reflected the growing costs of launching new products as it remained flat at 75% annually and was lower than the previous quarter's 75.7%.\n\nThe post-earnings share price drop appears to be attributed to a tepid guidance beat. Analysts had expected NVIDIA to guide $37.09 billion in revenue, and while NVIDIA's $37.5 billion in guidance did beat the estimates, it was weaker than many would have hoped. However, after recovering its losses to 1.33%, the stock continued its upward momentum and further pared back the losses to 0.75% to indicate that investors were coming to terms with growth's inevitable slowdown at the most valuable company in the world.\n\nNVIDIA's second-quarter earnings were also marked by worries about its latest Blackwell AI GPUs. During her remarks as part of the Q3 earnings, CFO Collette Kress mentioned Blackwell and the older Hopper GPUs. She shared that NVIDIA \"completed a successful mask change for Blackwell, our next Data Center architecture, that improved production yields.\"\n\nKress added that \"Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026,\" and NVIDIA would be \"shipping both Hopper and Blackwell systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and beyond.\" However, the CFO also cautioned that Hopper and Blackwell are facing supply constraints. According to her, \"Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.\"",
        "summary": "NVIDIA Corporation's third-quarter earnings for fiscal year 2025 exceeded analyst expectations, with the company reporting $35 billion in revenue and $20 billion in non-GAAP profit, surpassing the anticipated $33 billion in revenue and $18.4 billion in net income. Despite these strong financial results, NVIDIA's share price experienced a slight decline, attributed to weaker-than-expected guidance and concerns over supply constraints for its Blackwell AI GPUs. The company's gross margin remained flat at 75% annually, reflecting increased costs associated with new product launches. NVIDIA's CFO, Collette Kress, highlighted ongoing supply constraints for both Blackwell and Hopper GPUs, with demand for Blackwell expected to outstrip supply for several quarters into fiscal 2026. Investors appear to be adjusting to the company's growth slowdown, as the stock's initial post-earnings drop was partially recovered.",

Learn More\n\nThe Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price has dipped in after-hours trading following the release of the company's Q3 2024 results.\n\nThe stock closed at US$145.89 during Wednesday's US trading session but fell as much as 5% during after-hours trading before making a partial recovery to US$145.72 at the time of writing.\n\nShares were lower despite the company reporting record quarterly revenues, which grew 94% year over year, modestly beating analyst expectations. Fourth-quarter guidance, however, appears to have fallen short of investor expectations.\n\nThe chipmaker's impressive Q3 results are also a beacon for growth trends across the broader artificial intelligence (AI) gaming and data centre segments. Here's a look.\n\nNvidia share price dips despite record-breaking results\n\nNvidia's Q3 FY25 results delivered substantial growth across key areas, but this doesn't appear to be overly impressing investors. Here's what stood out:\n\nQuarterly revenue climbed 17% quarter on quarter and a staggering 94% year on year to US$35.1 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of US$33.17 billion\n\nData centre revenue reached a record US$30.8 billion, up 112% year on year\n\nNet income surged 109% year on year to US$19.31 billion, with diluted earnings per share increasing 111% to US$0.78\n\nGaming revenue grew 15% year on year to US$3.3 billion\n\nNvidia expects Q4 revenue to hit US$37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, alongside robust gross margins of 73% to 73.5%\n\nWhat else happened in Q3 FY25?\n\nThe Nvidia share price has been the talk of the town amongst investor circles this year. The chipmaker continued to expand its reach in AI-driven industries in Q3, securing several partnerships and product launches.\n\nThe company collaborated with cloud providers such as Amazon's AWS and Alphabet's Google Cloud to integrate its Hopper H200 GPUs in the data centre segment.\n\nThe data centre division continues to be a major growth driver for Nvidia. It booked nearly $31 billion in revenues for the quarter, which is roughly 88% of the top line.\n\nIt also announced Denmark's largest sovereign AI supercomputer and said AI adoption is increasing across industries.\n\nAutomotive revenue increased 72% year-on-year to US$449 million, driven by collaborations with automakers like Volvo and the integration of Nvidia's AI-powered systems into electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nOn the gaming front, Nvidia celebrated the 25th anniversary of its GeForce GPUs while launching RTX AI PCs and new titles featuring its advanced DLSS technology. These factors could impact the Nvidia share price.\n\nWhat did management say?\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang continues to see AI as a key theme of the future. On the topic, he stated:\n\nThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing. AI is transforming every industry, company and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionise workflows. Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI. And countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure.\n\nWhat's next for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's Q4 guidance points to sustained growth, with revenue expected to rise to US$37.5 billion.\n\nGross margins are set to be 70%, with operating expenses of $4.8 billion. Data centres will remain the key revenue segment, so be sure to watch out for the numbers there.\n\nAccording to the company:\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities.\n\nNvidia share price snapshot\n\nThe Nvidia share price has risen more than 200% year to date, reflecting its AI-fuelled growth trajectory.\n\nIts Q3 earnings beat expectations, so it will be key to see what the stock does in the days following the announcement.\n\nIn the last 12 months, the stock has risen more than 180%.",
        "summary": "Nvidia's Q3 FY25 results showed significant growth, with quarterly revenue increasing 94% year over year to $35.1 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. Despite these record-breaking results, Nvidia's share price dipped in after-hours trading, likely due to Q4 guidance not meeting investor expectations. The data center segment was a major growth driver, contributing nearly $31 billion in revenue, and Nvidia continued to expand its AI-driven industry reach through partnerships with major cloud providers. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized AI's transformative impact across industries, highlighting Nvidia's role in this global shift. Looking ahead, Nvidia expects Q4 revenue to reach $37.5 billion, with data centers remaining a key revenue segment.",

        "content": "Nvidia has reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust.\n\nFor the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago.\n\nNvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year’s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.\n\nWall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nInvestors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia’s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.\n\nNvidia’s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.\n\nAnalysts’ were eyeing Nvidia’s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers.\n\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.\n\nOn an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems “have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.”\n\n“Every customer is racing to be the first to market,” Kress said. “Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.”\n\nThe company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver “more Blackwells than we had previously estimated” this quarter, Huang added.\n\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\n\nThe company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang’s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia’s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company's third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.\n\nNvidia's fourth-quarter guidance was “a little bit disappointing,” said David Volpe, senior fund manager at Emerald Insights Fund, but the company still had “a tremendous quarter.\"\n\n“There’s nothing touching it in terms of the growth,” Volpe said.\n\nDemand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia's path to $4 trillion.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the earnings report shows “the AI Revolution is still in the early innings of playing out.”\n\n“We view this as a Nvidia earnings press release that should be hung in the Louvre,” Ives said. “Blackwell demand is just beginning. Any sell off (in Nvidia's stock) we would view as short lived, with our view this is a $4 trillion market cap in 2025 as the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) drives this spending wave.”\n\nThrough the year’s first six months, Nvidia’s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company’s earnings over the prior 12 months. That’s much more expensive than it’s been historically and than the S & P 500 in general.\n\n“The age of AI is upon us,\" Huang said on the call. \"And it’s large and diverse.”",

        "content": "NVIDIA's Grace Hopper Superchip is a processor designed from the ground up for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. — Image courtesy NVIDIA\n\nUS chipmaking behemoth Nvidia said Wednesday it made a $19 billion profit on record high revenue last quarter as demand continued for its hardware to power artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia reported quarterly sales of $35.1 billion, some $2 billion more than market expectations.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” said founder and chief executive Jensen Huang.\n\n“AI is transforming every industry, company and country.”\n\nHuang said that Nvidia’s keenly anticipated Blackwell processing platform is in full production and the company is seeing “incredible demand” for the new offering along with current-generation Hopper processors.\n\n“Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows,” Huang said.\n\n“Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI, and countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure.”\n\nNvidia surpassed Apple early this month to become the highest valued company in the world as the artificial intelligence boom continues to excite Wall Street.\n\nFollowing its quarterly report, Nvidia’s share price ebbed nearly two percent in after-hours trading to $143.24.\n\nInvestors may have been concerned about the company stating that its margin, the amount of money it makes off processors, is expected to narrow.\n\n“Despite Nvidia’s technological leadership through CUDA and its first-mover advantage in AI infrastructure, there’s little room for execution missteps in 2025,” said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.\n\n“Particularly given uncertainties around Blackwell’s rollout and increasing competition from both AMD and key customers’ in-house chip development efforts.”\n\nThe market is also likely weighing geopolitical factors, such as the potential for trade turbulence with China after Donald Trump returns to the White House in January.\n\nNvidia relies on TSMC in Taiwan for its coveted graphics processing units.\n\nThe world’s biggest tech companies have invested tens of billions of dollars into Nvidia’s powerful AI chips and software to get their ChatGPT-style AI models up and running.\n\nMicrosoft, Google, Meta, Tesla and Amazon all depend on Nvidia technology to train generative AI models and execute the heavy computing workloads needed to deploy the new technology.\n\nAhead of the latest earnings, Nvidia’s share price had nearly tripled year-to-date and has accounted for a third of the broad-based S&P 500 index’s gains this year.",

Despite its success, NVIDIA's share price dipped slightly due to concerns about narrowing profit margins and potential execution challenges in 2025, amid increasing competition and geopolitical uncertainties. NVIDIA has become the highest valued company in the world, surpassing Apple, as major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon rely on its technology for AI model training and deployment.

        "content": "NVIDIA's Grace Hopper Superchip is a processor designed from the ground up for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. — Image courtesy NVIDIA\n\nUS chipmaking behemoth Nvidia said Wednesday it made a $19 billion profit on record high revenue last quarter as demand continued for its hardware to power artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia reported quarterly sales of $35.1 billion, some $2 billion more than market expectations.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” said founder and chief executive Jensen Huang.\n\n“AI is transforming every industry, company and country.”\n\nHuang said that Nvidia’s keenly anticipated Blackwell processing platform is in full production and the company is seeing “incredible demand” for the new offering along with current-generation Hopper processors.\n\n“Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows,” Huang said.\n\n“Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI, and countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure.”\n\nNvidia surpassed Apple early this month to become the highest valued company in the world as the artificial intelligence boom continues to excite Wall Street.\n\nFollowing its quarterly report, Nvidia’s share price ebbed nearly two percent in after-hours trading to $143.24.\n\nInvestors may have been concerned about the company stating that its margin, the amount of money it makes off processors, is expected to narrow.\n\n“Despite Nvidia’s technological leadership through CUDA and its first-mover advantage in AI infrastructure, there’s little room for execution missteps in 2025,” said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.\n\n“Particularly given uncertainties around Blackwell’s rollout and increasing competition from both AMD and key customers’ in-house chip development efforts.”\n\nThe market is also likely weighing geopolitical factors, such as the potential for trade turbulence with China after Donald Trump returns to the White House in January.\n\nNvidia relies on TSMC in Taiwan for its coveted graphics processing units.\n\nThe world’s biggest tech companies have invested tens of billions of dollars into Nvidia’s powerful AI chips and software to get their ChatGPT-style AI models up and running.\n\nMicrosoft, Google, Meta, Tesla and Amazon all depend on Nvidia technology to train generative AI models and execute the heavy computing workloads needed to deploy the new technology.\n\nAhead of the latest earnings, Nvidia’s share price had nearly tripled year-to-date and has accounted for a third of the broad-based S&P 500 index’s gains this year.",
        "summary": "NVIDIA reported a $19 billion profit on record high revenue of $35.1 billion last quarter, driven by strong demand for its AI and high-performance computing hardware. The company is experiencing significant demand for its new Blackwell processing platform and current-generation Hopper processors, as AI continues to transform industries globally. Despite its success, NVIDIA's share price dipped slightly due to concerns about narrowing profit margins and potential execution challenges in 2025, amid increasing competition and geopolitical uncertainties. NVIDIA has become the highest valued company in the world, surpassing Apple, as major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon rely on its technology for AI model training and deployment. The company's stock has nearly tripled this year, contributing significantly to the S&P 500 index's gains.",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust.\n\nFor the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago.\n\nNvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year’s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.\n\nWall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nInvestors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia’s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.\n\nNvidia’s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.\n\nAnalysts’ were eyeing Nvidia’s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers.\n\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.\n\nOn an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems “have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.”\n\n“Every customer is racing to be the first to market,” Kress said. “Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.”\n\nThe company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver “more Blackwells than we had previously estimated” this quarter, Huang added.\n\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\n\nThe company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang’s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia’s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company's third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.\n\nStory Continues",
        "summary": "Nvidia reported a significant increase in third-quarter profit and sales, driven by strong demand for its AI-focused computer chips, with revenue reaching $35.08 billion, a 94% increase from the previous year. The company's earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, although its stock saw a slight decline in after-hours trading. Nvidia's data center revenue surged by 112%, largely due to the demand for its Hopper computing platform, and the company anticipates further growth with the upcoming Blackwell graphics processor unit. Despite supply constraints, Nvidia plans to increase Blackwell shipments, with production starting in fiscal 2025 and ramping up into fiscal 2026. Nvidia's strategic focus on AI technology has solidified its position as a leader in the sector, contributing to its substantial stock market growth and continued innovation in chip technology.",

Revenue from the Data Center segment, Nvidia’s key growth driver, reached a record $30.8 billion, up 112% from the same period last year.\n\nJensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, called the quarter a reflection of “AI in full steam” as enterprises adopt Nvidia’s Hopper GPUs and anticipate the launch of its next-generation Blackwell platform.\n\nThe tech giant has been riding high this year following an explosion of investor interest in AI-related firms and businesses. That has helped drive the Nasdaq to record heights amid prospects of a return to cheaper borrowing should the U.S. Federal Reserve continue to slash its benchmark rate.\n\nDespite strong results, Nvidia’s stock fell 0.76% during regular trading and dropped another 2.39% in after-hours, closing at $142.40.\n\nAnalysts attributed the decline to profit-taking after Nvidia's year-long rally, along with cautious reactions to the company’s Q4 guidance.\n\nNvidia expects revenue of $37.5 billion for the next quarter, representing a 7% sequential increase and aligning with analyst forecasts.\n\nNvidia’s gaming segment also saw steady growth, reporting $3.3 billion in revenue, up 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. However, smaller segments like Automotive and Professional Visualization, while growing, contributed modestly to overall revenue.\n\nWhile results underscore Nvidia's dominance in the AI and accelerated computing space, concerns over the company’s soaring valuation and supply constraints for its GPUs could weigh on the stock in the short term.\n\nNvidia will hold a conference call with analysts later Wednesday to provide further insights into its outlook.",

REUTERS\n\nThe new line of processors has been embraced by Nvidia’s customers and the company will exceed its initial projections of several billion dollars in sales of the processors in the fourth quarter, finance chief Colette Kress told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday.\n\n“We will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated,” CEO Jensen Huang said.\n\nInitially the new line of chips will carry gross margins in the low 70% range, but will increase to the mid 70% range when production ramps up, Kress said.\n\nThe company forecast revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% for the fourth quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $37.09 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nStill a stunning rate of growth thanks to huge demand for the company’s chips that make up the brains of complex generative AI systems, it marks a clear slowdown from previous quarters when Nvidia mostly posted sales that at least doubled.\n\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell – in full production – are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference,” he said, referring to two high-performing AI chips.\n\n3 Nvidia stock has nearly quadrupled so far this year and is up more than nine-fold over the last two years. REUTERS\n\nExpectations ran high ahead of the results, with Nvidia shares up more than 20% over the last two months. The stock has nearly quadrupled so far this year and is up more than nine-fold over the last two years.\n\n“Investors have become accustomed to huge beats from this company, but doing that is getting harder and harder,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. “This was still a very solid report, but the truth is when the bar is this high it makes things just that much tougher.”\n\nWhile demand is soaring for the company’s chips that make up the brains of complex generative AI systems, supply-chain snags have made it harder for Nvidia to report the big beats on revenue that have helped make it a Wall Street darling.\n\nOne of the bottlenecks for its chip supply has been the limited capacity for advanced manufacturing techniques at the company’s manufacturing partner TSMC.\n\n3 Supply-chain snags have made it harder for Nvidia to report the big beats on revenue that have helped make it a Wall Street darling. via REUTERS\n\nThe company recorded third-quarter adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, compared to estimates of 75 cents per share.\n\nSales in the data-center segment, which accounts for a majority of Nvidia’s revenue, grew 112% to $30.77 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 27. The segment had recorded growth of 154% in the prior quarter.\n\nNvidia’s sales are boosted by cloud companies’ continued spending on its chips, as they expand data centers capable of handling generative AI’s complex processing needs.\n\nThe company said it had fixed a design flaw with its Blackwell chips by changing the blueprints used by TSMC to manufacture it.\n\n“Rumblings of potential supply chain issues are clearly causing some concerns,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.\n\nThe company said adjusted gross margin shrank to 75%.",
        "summary": "Nvidia's fourth-quarter revenue forecast slightly exceeded estimates but fell short of some investors' high expectations, leading to a slight drop in its stock price. The company is launching its new Blackwell AI chips, which initially will have lower gross margins but are expected to improve as production increases. Despite a slowdown in growth compared to previous quarters, Nvidia's revenue is still growing significantly due to high demand for its AI chips, although supply-chain issues, particularly with manufacturing partner TSMC, pose challenges. Nvidia's data-center segment saw a 112% increase in sales, driven by cloud companies expanding their data centers to support generative AI. The company addressed a design flaw in its Blackwell chips and reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, surpassing estimates.",
