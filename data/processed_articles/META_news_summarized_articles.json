Images: Meta / Nintendo\n\nLike Nintendo’s simplistic motion control-based sports series, Home Sports offers several games: hockey, badminton, pickleball, mini-golf, and bowling. It’s playable solo and multiplayer, where your Meta avatar represents you in a match. Meta says the game can adapt to your play space, but it also uses the Quest boundaryless mode for those with access to wide-open spaces.\n\nA blatant knockoff of Nintendo’s Sports series it may be, but I’m not mad.\n\nIt’ll be hard to replicate the crucial component of a group of people holding Wii remotes and watching each other fail at bowling. However, this could be a good time, assuming that developer Resolution Games otherwise got the feel right and you have enough headsets to go around.",

        "description": "This is a helpful guide that outlines the recommended aspect ratios by ad placement, which often conflict with what Meta requests.\nThe post Recommended Aspect Ratios By Placement for Meta Ad Creative appeared first on Jon Loomer Digital.",

        "publish_date": "2024-11-25T21:25:29Z",
        "content": "Share via: Share\n\nPost\n\nEmail\n\nIt is highly likely that you are using ad creative that fall outside of Meta’s recommended aspect ratios. You would be forgiven if this is the case since Meta’s own process for uploading images and videos all but assures that this will happen.\n\nOf course, it will take some additional work to accomplish the goal of providing optimally sized images and videos for your ads. But this post will help highlight precisely what you need to do for that to become a reality.\n\nI recorded a short video about how Meta recommends a 4:5 aspect ratio for many of the placements where you’re likely using 1:1. But, it’s not quite that simple. The recommended aspect ratio often depends on whether you are using a video or a static image.\n\nLet’s clear up any confusion so that you can use optimally-sized creative going forward.\n\nAspect Ratio Grid\n\nLet’s jump right to the most important resource that you’ll want to save for later.\n\nPlacements are listed in the “placement groups” that are created when uploading your creative in Ads Manager (we’ll get to that in a minute). On the right are Meta’s actual recommended aspect ratios for videos and static images in those placements.\n\nThose recommendations often conflict with the aspect ratios that Meta requests when assigning placement groups.\n\nCreative Upload Confusion\n\nWhen you create your ad, Meta attempts to simplify the process of creative upload by asking you to provide three different variations:\n\n1:1\n\n9:16\n\n1.91:1\n\nWhen you do this, Meta automatically assigns those variations to different placement groups.\n\n1:1 for Feeds, In-stream ads for videos and reels, Search results\n\n9:16 for Stories and Reels, Apps and sites\n\n1.91:1 for Right column, Search results\n\nThis would be great if these placement groups were consistent with Meta’s own recommendations, but they’re often not.\n\nRecommendation Sources\n\nThere are a few resources that I relied upon when creating my grid.\n\nIt was this table that got my attention in the first place. It highlights both the accepted and recommended aspect ratios for each placement. Here’s an example of what it looks like…\n\n2. Placement Previews\n\nWhat’s interesting is that most of the recommendations in the table above are consistent with what Meta recommends in placement previews. Here’s an example for Facebook Feed.\n\nMeta recommends 4:5 for both images and videos in the Facebook Feed even though advertisers are asked to upload 1:1 creative for that placement during the ad creation process.\n\nThis resource is a bit less detailed than the table, but it helped answer some questions when I was seeing conflicting information.\n\nThis resource covers quite a bit more beyond creative aspect ratios, and the recommendations aren’t always explicit. But this is how I came up with the 1:1 recommendation for right hand column. While the table mentions it as an option, this resource actually recommends it.\n\nConflicts\n\nYou’ll see this within the grid at the top of this post, but let’s summarize the conflicts that I found. Most of the conflicts are for videos, particularly within the placement group that Meta assigns 1:1.\n\nWhile the aspect ratios that Meta asks you to create will still work, these are the cases where they may not be the most optimal…\n\nFacebook Feed: Meta recommends 4:5 for both videos and images (1:1 upload requested)\n\nFacebook In-Stream Videos: Meta recommends 16:9 or 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nAds on Facebook Reels: Meta recommends 9:16 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nFacebook Marketplace: Meta recommends 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nFacebook Profile Feed: Meta recommends 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nFacebook Video Feeds: Meta recommends 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nInstagram Feed: Meta recommends 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nInstagram Explore: Meta recommends 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nInstagram Explore Home: Meta recommends 4:5 or 9:16 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nInstagram Profile Feed: Meta recommends 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nFacebook Business Explore: Meta recommends 4:5 videos (1:1 upload requested)\n\nFacebook Search Results: Meta recommends 1:1 videos (1.91:1 upload requested)\n\nFacebook Right Column: Meta recommends 1:1 for both videos and images (1.91:1 upload requested)\n\nHow to Customize by Placement\n\nNow that you have a guide for which aspect ratios to use for each placement, let’s discuss how you’ll execute it.\n\n1. When you upload your creative at the start, your approach will be different depending on whether you are using videos or images. If videos, provide 4:5, 9:16, and 1:1 for the initial placement groups. If images, provide 1:1, 9:16, and 1:1.\n\n2. Now you will need to customize your creative by placement. Let’s assume that you are using an image and uploaded a 1:1 version for one of the placement groups. That will satisfy Meta’s recommendations for almost all of the feed placements, except for Facebook Feed.\n\nWithin the Media section, expand the Feeds group. Then hover over Facebook Feed and click the “Edit” icon.\n\nOn the left, click to change the media for the selected placement.\n\nOnce you upload and select a new image, an icon will appear indicating that you’ve made a customization to that placement.\n\nYou will then need to repeat this for every placement where there’s a conflict. You may even choose to provide a mix of images and videos for a single ad, depending on the placement. That will require a reasonable amount of work, but you may find it worthwhile if an improvement in performance follows.\n\nYour Turn\n\nEverything in this post is subject to change, of course. My hope is that Meta will change the initial upload process so that the requested aspect ratios are consistent with their recommendations. Until then, you’ll need to do a bit of manual work.\n\nAre there any other conflicts that I missed? Let me know in the comments below!",

Before, advertisers could track how users bought a product after seeing an ad. The tech giant’s probabilistic models “are working better than the old tracking system ever did,” Yu said.\n\nMeta is also “erasing the line between content and advertising,” Yu said, by using AI to make items in images and videos on social media feeds purchasable. The company “isn’t just creating ad inventory — it’s turning everything into potential inventory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica (EL+4.33% ) on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gives it an AI-advantage that doesn’t threaten its business.\n\nMeanwhile, Google is struggling to integrate AI into its products without threatening its search business, Yu said, which “thrives on simplicity, directing users to click on links that generate ad revenue.” With AI chatbots that can provide direct answers to queries, users don’t have to visit web pages where ads are placed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Google’s other AI features, such as NotebookLM, “don’t necessarily strengthen its primary revenue stream.”\n\nMeta was the third-highest tech company on the Center for Future Readiness’s Future Readiness Indicator after Nvidia (NVDA-4.27% ) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.43% ), due to its “aggressive investments in AI” that show “strong momentum, impacting nearly all aspects of its operations,” the report said. Google parent Alphabet was the fourth-highest tech company on the list.",
        "summary": "Despite being a pioneer in artificial intelligence research, Google is not expected to benefit significantly from the AI transformation, according to Howard Yu, a professor at IMD Business School. Yu argues that Google's core business model, which relies on simple search and link-clicking, is being undermined by AI advancements, while Meta's advertising ecosystem is being enhanced by AI. Meta has successfully adapted its AI-powered advertising system to changes like Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature and is integrating AI to blur the lines between content and advertising. Additionally, Meta's partnership with EssilorLuxottica on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses provides an AI advantage without threatening its business model. In contrast, Google struggles to integrate AI into its products without jeopardizing its search business, as AI chatbots can provide direct answers, reducing the need for users to click on ad-generating links.",

        "content": "As we reported last week, Threads has begun to globally roll out Custom Feeds based on specific topics. And Meta seems to be really listening to users recently, as the company is now testing an option to let users set which feed they want to see by default.\n\nThreads will have option to choose default feed\n\nThe news was shared by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post on Threads. According to him, the platform is now “testing” the option to choose any feed as the default. This includes choosing not only between For You and Following, but also a custom one. This means that users will be able to choose which feed they see first when they open Threads.\n\n“Testing the option to choose any feed — For You, following, or a custom one — as your default. Also making this more visible in the app. Interested to see how and if people use this,” Zuckerberg said.\n\nCurrently, the Threads app opens in the For Your feed by default. This is the feed with suggested content based on algorithms. More recently, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri revealed that Meta is changing the Threads algorithms to prioritize posts from accounts followed by the user, another long-standing request from those who use Threads.\n\nUsers can swipe down on the Threads home screen to access the Following feed, which, as the name suggests, only shows posts from accounts you follow. The same applies to Custom Feeds – but the app always returns to the For You feed after being closed and reopened.\n\nMany users have noticed that Meta has been ramping up the development of new features for Threads recently. Although the company didn’t say a word, some believe that this is related to the rapid growth of Bluesky in recent months. While Threads still has far more users than Bluesky, its competing platform has gained more than 13 million users in the space of a year.\n\nThere are no details on which users will have access to the new features first or when Meta plans to make it available to everyone. In any case, make sure you have the latest version of the app installed in order to get access to the new features. The Threads app is available for free on the App Store.\n\nRead also",
        "summary": "Meta is testing a new feature on Threads that allows users to set their preferred default feed, choosing between For You, Following, or a custom feed. This change, announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, aims to give users more control over their viewing experience by letting them decide which feed appears first when they open the app. Currently, Threads defaults to the For You feed, which is algorithm-based, but users can manually switch to the Following feed or a custom feed. The development of this feature comes amid increased competition from platforms like Bluesky, which has seen significant user growth. While there's no specific timeline for the rollout, users are encouraged to keep their app updated to access new features as they become available.",

        "content": "Now that Warzone Season 1 has integrated the game with Black Ops 6, the Call of Duty battle royale lets players use more weapons, attachments and lethal and tactical grenades than ever before.\n\nThere are a staggering 177 primary, secondary and melee weapons from Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 6 to choose from -- but you can't unlock the entire arsenal by simply leveling up your account.\n\nThere's a careful balance to Warzone: Old battle pass and event weapons, attachments and aftermarket conversion kits are earned by players who participated in live challenges, so they're relatively exclusive. Each battle royale match needs to be a level playing field, and some of the old items are still part of meta loadouts.\n\nThat's where the new Armory comes in, letting players work toward unlocking these items from older games and events one at a time as they earn XP in-game.\n\nEverything you can earn in the Warzone Armory\n\nYou can earn weapons, attachments, aftermarket conversion kits and grenades through the new and improved Warzone Armory. Activision\n\nThe Warzone Armory allows players to earn any previously obtainable event weapon, attachment or aftermarket weapon conversion kit available in the game. That includes content from Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 6.\n\nA prior iteration of the Armory lets players earn new items by completing daily challenges, but now weapons and attachments can be earned more consistently. All players can earn Black Ops 6 weapons and attachments during live battle passes and events, but Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 content has remained locked for new Warzone players -- until now.\n\nPlayers can select one item from the Armory at a time, working toward acquiring the new weapon or attachment by earning account XP. Weapons and attachments are locked behind 75,000 XP each, which can be earned in Warzone or Black Ops 6 multiplayer modes.\n\nYou only earn XP toward the item you've chosen, so it's important to make sure you select a new weapon or attachment after you unlock the previous one you were working toward.\n\nHow does the Armory work in Black Ops 6?\n\nNew weapons and attachments are added through battle passes and events in Black Ops 6. Activision\n\nThere's also an Armory for multiplayer matches in Black Ops 6, which will function much the same as the Warzone Armory, although there's no path to unlocking any of the previous content from the Modern Warfare games. Instead, this version of the feature allows players to unlock weapons and attachments they may have missed in previous Black Ops 6-specific events and battle passes.\n\nThe Season 1 battle pass, for instance, includes the Saug SMG, Krig-C assault rifle and the Dragon's Breath incendiary shotgun ammo. Additionally, the Season 1 event Hit List also introduced the Power Drill melee weapon, Sirin 9mm SMG and the buffer weight stock attachment.\n\nAnyone who completes these goals will unlock the new arsenal additions straight away, but the Armory ensures they'll never be gone forever.\n\nThe Sirin 9mm SMG is the first \"special\" secondary weapon, taking up the secondary loadout slot. That means you can pair it up with a sniper rifle, assault rifle or LMG. Activision\n\nOnce a season is over, all of the weapons and attachments added to the game will be added to the Black Ops 6 Armory, allowing players to work toward earning these coveted goodies by completing daily challenges.\n\nHaving to level up dozens of new weapons to make them combat-ready might sound overwhelming -- that grind is a lot easier if you activate double weapon XP tokens. If you want to learn more about how to get and use double XP tokens in Black Ops 6, we have a double XP token guide for you.\n\nWarzone Armory FAQs\n\nWhen do I unlock the Armory in Warzone? The Warzone Armory is unlocked when you reach player level 24. Once you have access to the Armory, you're available to start working toward unlocking any of the items contained within immediately.",

The game now features 177 weapons from Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, and Black Ops 6, but not all can be unlocked by simply leveling up. The new Warzone Armory allows players to earn previously exclusive items by gaining XP, with each item requiring 75,000 XP to unlock. In Black Ops 6, a similar Armory system lets players unlock weapons and attachments from past events and battle passes. Players can earn these items by completing daily challenges, and double XP tokens can help speed up the process.",

Meta, then known as Facebook, overpaid for Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate nascent threats instead of competing on its own in the mobile ecosystem, the FTC claims.\n\nJudge James Boasberg set trial in the case for April 14.\n\nBoasberg earlier this month rejected Meta's argument that the case should be dismissed as it depends on an overly narrow view of social media markets. The lawsuit does not account for competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube, X, and Microsoft's LinkedIn, Meta had argued.\n\nBoasberg said that while the case should go forward to trial, \"time and technological change pose serious challenges\" to the FTC's market definition.\n\n\"The Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial. Indeed, its positions at times strain this country's creaking antitrust precedents to their limits,\" the judge said in the Nov. 13 ruling.",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks.\n\nWith the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well.\n\nConsider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%.\n\nNaturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that \"it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions.\" This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to \"prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system.\"\n\nTo prove that \"equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth,\" the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that \"market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House.\" The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns.\n\nSimilarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank \"urges caution\" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets.\n\nShifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.'\n\nBetween then and now, the bank believes that \"generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage.\" This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms \"building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling.\"\n\nWhile generative AI might be in the \"trough of disillusionment,\" the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the \"overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032\" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions.\n\nWithin the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software.\n\nHowever, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market.\n\nAccording to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is \"more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud.\" This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank.\n\nYet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nConsensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The company is experimenting with allowing users to set the non-algorithmic “following” feed as the default, Mark Zuckerberg shared in a post.\n\nThe change, according to Zuckerberg, will allow users to select any feed as their default, including the newly announced custom feeds. But longtime Threads users will likely be relieved to finally have the ability to make “following” their default view. Up until now, Meta has pushed users to its “for you” algorithmic feed, which has long been criticized for its problems with engagement bait and its uncanny ability to push a mix of bizarre posts from total strangers to the top of users’ feeds\n\nAs part of the test, Meta will also make the ability to change your feed “more visible” in the app. Zuckerberg didn’t share how many users would be part of the test or how long it might take for the feature to become official. “Interested to see how and if people use this,” he wrote.\n\nThe update is the latest in a series of changes Meta has pushed over the last couple of weeks as it has faced surging growth from rival Bluesky. Bluesky, which has seen an influx of new users since the election, defaults to a feed of content from accounts you follow and doesn’t have a centralized algorithmic feed, though it’s had custom feeds for more than a year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-latest-test-will-finally-let-you-make-the-following-feed-the-default-180857332.html?src=rss",

        "content": "Polish billionaire Rafal Brzoska says he has won his court battle against Meta over the use of his image in AI-generated deepfake ads.\n\nBrzoska, the billionaire founder and CEO of parcel company InPost SA, took legal action against Meta after discovering deepfake ads using images of him and his wife Omena Mensah on Facebook in Poland.\n\nIn a complaint to Poland’s Personal Data Protection Office in July, Brzoska identified “as many as 263 ads” featuring images of him or his wife, who is a TV host, to lure people into fraudulent investment platforms.\n\nIn August, Poland’s Personal Data Protection Office imposed a three-month ban blocking Meta from publishing deepfake ads using images of Brzoska and Mensah.\n\nHowever, Brzoska later told Bloomberg that the Polish Personal Data Protection Office’s three-month ban had not stopped new deepfake images of him and his wife surfacing on Meta’s platforms.\n\nThe billionaire said he was considering further legal action against Meta, believing that the company should be held responsible for the ads. Brzoska said that he was also waiting on Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which oversees Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin, to impose a similar ban.\n\n“It will be the long battle, and I want to find out how big are revenues from ads that use deepfakes for fraudulent purposes,” Broska told Bloomberg at the time.\n\nAccording to reports by Polish news outlets, Brzoska says that the court has sided with him in his lawsuit against Meta. The billionaire says that Meta would incur fines for every future deepfake image of him and his wife shared on its platforms for one year.\n\n“We applied for security, so that each subsequent deepfake with our image would result in an immediate financial penalty on the owner of Facebook,” Brzoska writes in a post on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) on Thursday.\n\n“The court fully agreed with us and granted us security for the maximum possible time, i.e. one year.”\n\nBrzoska also asked his social media followers to send any screenshots and links to deepfake ads of him and his wife that they might see online.\n\nBrzoska said that he was confident the ruling from the Polish court, although limited to Poland, could set a wider precedent for protecting individuals’ rights in the digital age. He also called on other public figures to share their experiences with deepfake ads and join his campaign against Meta profiting from such content.\n\nMeta is facing increasing pressure around the world to stop the proliferation of deepfake ads and scams. A U.S. judge this year ruled that Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest could sue Meta over deepfake Facebook ads that show him promoting fake cryptocurrency and other fraudulent investments.\n\n\n\nImage credits: Header photo via Wikimedia Commons/ CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\n",

Now, more than a year later, Threads is finally testing the ability for users to do so.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Monday that the social network is now testing the option for users to choose their For You, Following, or a custom feed as their default one.\n\nThe launch comes a few days after Threads rolled out custom feeds to allow users to curate feeds around specific topics or certain user profiles. The tool allows Threads to compete with Bluesky, a decentralized social network that lets users build their own algorithms, feeds, and lists.\n\nMeta has been moving quickly to update Threads at a time when many X users are moving to Bluesky, which has now surpassed 20 million users. The recent changes to the app indicate that Meta is looking to appease users by listening to their feedback and giving them what they want in an effort to keep them from moving to Bluesky.\n\nLast week, the platform rolled out changes to surface more content from people you follow in the app’s “For You” algorithmic feed. While some people welcomed the change, others responded to Instagram head Adam Mosseri’s announcement post with frustration, noting that they simply want the option to set their Following feed as their default feed.\n\nFast-forward a few days, and now users have the option to do so. In his announcement post, Zuckerberg said he’s “interested to see how and if people use this.”\n\nThe new feature is rolling out to select users, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email.\n\nAlthough Threads has a solid user base of more than 275 million monthly active users, it’s facing increased competition from Bluesky. Data from market intelligence firm Similarweb shows that Bluesky is catching up with Threads when it comes to daily active users and that if the social network can keep up its current growth rate, it could eventually catch up with Threads.",

RSVP .\n\nAfter nearly two months of testing TikTok’s Smart+—which lets AI optimize creative and choose who to serve an ad—there are some areas for improvement, four ad buyers told ADWEEK. Especially when compared to Meta’s Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC), which launched in 2022.\n\nGranted, Meta’s ASC has had more time to finesse its AI-buying tool, but vying for ad dollars is a competitive business. And advertisers’ growing gripes about set-it-and-forget-it tools—from lack of transparency and inventory quality to ads reaching existing audiences—have been hard to ignore.\n\nThat said, Smart+ isn’t without its wins. Some DTC brands at agency Wpromote saw a 10% lift in conversions compared to traditional TikTok campaigns.\n\nIn terms of conversion rates, TikTok is at parity with Meta’s ASC, with a 5% margin either way, according to David Dweck, svp, paid media, Wpromote.\n\nSince its October launch, brands have flagged inconsistent performance with TikTok Smart+—some even pulled their campaigns—and the tool’s lack of detailed revenue data beyond basic metrics like impressions and conversions has made it tough to gauge its true effectiveness.\n\nMeta’s ASC, sources said, seems to have relatively reliable performance and granular controls. Revenue from ACS more than doubled from last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call. Meta also said in October that over 1 million advertisers have used at least one of its gen AI tools monthly, with 15 million ads created in the last month.\n\nHere are ways buyers believe TikTok’s Smart+ can catch up with Meta.\n\nMore controls for advertisers to fine-tune\n\nMeta’s ASC system offers more levers for advertisers to fine-tune campaigns, zeroing in on top-performing creatives and investing in those with the most potential, according to Miki DeHaven, VML’s associate media director.\n\n“[It becomes] clear that the machine [is] learning with time,” said DeHaven, with Advantage+ identifying and leaning into the top-performing assets quickly.\n\nCustom agreements lead to more performance visibility\n\nWhile Meta’s ASC isn’t perfect, agencies like Wpromote have custom agreements with the tech giant that let it A/B test creative assets on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThis arrangement, according to Dweck, provides a tailored product integrated directly with their tools, giving deeper insights into creative performance—insights Wpromote finds more accessible on Meta than on TikTok.\n\nIn that sense, “TikTok [insights aren’t] necessarily stronger than the Meta’s Advantage+ but close to parity,” he said.\n\nPangle, TikTok’s external ad network, extends campaign reach to third-party apps, but advertisers cannot opt out of Pangle app placements within Smart+ campaigns, said Zaryn Sidhu, growth marketing consultant at M&H Digital. Performance data reports do not break out whether the placement was served on TikTok or Pangle.\n\n“[This] prevents media buyers from gleaning any placement-specific insights and without a clear understanding on budget distribution, which can greatly impact performance,” said Sidhu.\n\nGreater audience reach\n\nMeta’s ASC lets advertisers cap spending on retargeting and prioritize new customer acquisition—key for avoiding wasted impressions and a common complaint of AI ad buying tools.\n\nSmart+ lacks this feature, casting a wide net and hitting users who might have already seen the ad or even made a purchase, according to DeHaven.\n\nMore ad placements across the ecosystem\n\nMeta benefits from its extensive ecosystem—Facebook, Instagram, and Threads (which plans to roll out ads)—where it can serve its ads. Similarly, Google’s Performance Max benefits from cross-platform reach across YouTube, Gmail and Search.\n\n“The flexibility isn’t quite there with TikTok,” said Jack Johnston, senior social innovation director, Tinuiti. “Costs can fluctuate widely—either higher or lower—while with Meta, we see impressions shift across its ecosystem based on efficiency, helping us target users where they’re consuming media.”\n\nEase of integration\n\nUsing Meta, advertisers can swap image backgrounds or expand images in creative assets within ASC, according to Johnston. TikTok, meanwhile, currently has a less streamlined setup.\n\n“For brands, it’s an extra step,” said Johnston. “You have to go into Symphony, brief the content, confirm you like it, and then export it to Ads Manager.”",
        "summary": "ADWEEK House is hosting an event in Las Vegas on January 8, offering a space for networking and relaxation during a major consumer tech event. TikTok's Smart+ advertising tool, which uses AI to optimize ad delivery, has shown some success, such as a 10% increase in conversions for certain brands, but it still faces challenges compared to Meta's Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC). Advertisers have noted issues with Smart+, including inconsistent performance, lack of detailed revenue data, and limited control over ad placements, which contrasts with Meta's more refined and transparent system. Meta's ASC offers more granular controls, allowing advertisers to fine-tune campaigns and gain deeper insights into creative performance, while TikTok's Smart+ lacks features like spending caps on retargeting and broader audience reach. Additionally, Meta's extensive ecosystem and ease of integration provide advertisers with more flexibility and efficiency, whereas TikTok's setup is less streamlined, requiring extra steps for content management.",

        "content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works\n\nby geralt via Pixabay\n\nInstagram has become the latest app to get support for live location sharing. Its maker, Meta, announced on Monday that the feature is part of Direct Messages (DMs), allowing you to share your real-time location with your friends during conversations.\n\nThe social media behemoth isn't a stranger to live location sharing, as its other platforms, WhatsApp and Messenger, have embraced the feature for years. However, Instagram's live location feature lets you share your location for up to one hour.\n\nTo share location in a conversation, tap on the + button in the bottom right corner and choose Location.\n\nMoreover, you can pin a spot on the map to coordinate arrival times and activities or locate your friends in crowded places like concerts and other outdoor events. You can share live location privately in one-to-one conversations or group chats.\n\nWhen sharing your location, Instagram will display an indicator at the top of the chat as a reminder to turn it off when not required. A privacy check is that the location shared in a chat can't be forwarded to other chats.\n\nThe company said in a blog post that Instagram's live location sharing is currently available in select countries. Meta has also introduced 17 new sticker packs for Instagram with over 300 stickers, which you can share in your DMs.\n\nAnother update lets you add nicknames for yourself and your friends on Instagram DMs. In other words, you can refer to other users by names that might be familiar or easier to recognize. To create a nickname, you can tap on the chat name at the top, tap Nicknames, and select the username of the person that you want to nickname.\n\nA nickname you create only appears in your DM chats, and everyone can see it, but it doesn't change your username in other places across the app. You can choose if other people can change your nickname in a chat.",
        "summary": "Instagram has introduced a new feature for live location sharing within Direct Messages, allowing users to share their real-time location with friends for up to one hour. This feature, already available on Meta's other platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger, can be used in one-to-one or group chats and includes a reminder to turn it off when not needed. Users can also pin locations on a map to coordinate activities or find friends in crowded areas, with the assurance that shared locations cannot be forwarded to other chats. Additionally, Instagram has launched 17 new sticker packs and a feature to add nicknames in DMs, which are visible only within the chat and do not alter usernames elsewhere on the app. These updates are currently available in select countries, enhancing user interaction and personalization on the platform.",

Do you also make products which are then taken up globally?\n\nAnd these can also be replicated globally?\n\nSo, what are the other Made-in-India solutions that can go global?\n\nComing to regulations, it appears that global companies like Meta are averse to regulations?\n\nSandhya Devanathan has spent almost two years in India as head of American social media giant Meta. The period has seen the company expand its business while growing consumer engagement across all its platforms - Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp . But amidst this fast-paced growth, the company has also faced severe regulatory challenges.The latest being CCI's penalty on charges that the company illegally shared certain user data of WhatsApp with Insta and Facebook for targeted advertising.The matter is sub-judice as Meta has decided to challenge it. We speak to Devanathan on how she perceives India as a market and how Meta takes products developed here global.India continues to remain a super important market for Meta globally. It's one of the largest user markets for us and the trends that we're seeing here are definitely about continued growth and engagement across all our platforms. It's not just Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, but even for the recently-launched Threads, India is one of the largest markets globally with over 200 million downloads. We're seeing continued momentum and growth, across the board. Also, we are witnessing an equally strong adoption of newer products such as AI platform Llama.I think we are almost sort of using India as the playbook, you know, for global.Consider this: India was one of the first countries to test and launch (Instagram) Reels in 2020. Today, it's one of the strongest products that we have globally. India is also the first country where we launched Payments onWhatsApp Business . Also, India is the biggest market for Meta AI in terms of usage. It is among the top three markets globally for the adoption of our open-source large language AI model Llama.In fact, when we launched WhatsApp Flows last year, we launched it first in India. Mark (Zuckerberg) announced it. Then we took it global. So, this is very much one of the things that India has been doing. I and the team remain proud of this - how we make India the centre of where we innovate, where we build products and then take them global, all because we have that scale here.I see that happening even now, when it comes to some of the other tests that we're running. For example, we are piloting in India a test around small business calling on WhatsApp. Basically, it's about when you're chatting with a small business on WhatsApp and suddenly the chat is not enough and you want to talk to a person. It's not automatically calling a business but remains within the context of the chat. You can then call the business. It has also been built with an India first lens.Yeah. Now we'll announce it globally. But the lead came from, very much India.Today, Llama has been growing globally where it has over 400 million downloads. Many of them are from India, and so India is a very large market. Developers here are downloading Llama and then building solutions, tools and whatever on top of that. So, I think there too, India's playing a very significant role, just given the size and the adoption that we're seeing. India is a big contributor to that as well.On AI as well, India will play a pretty critical role in terms of adoption, usage and development of Llama.We welcome regulation, especially if it's progressive. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act was a perfect example of that for us.",

A provision in Llama’s terms of service previously prohibited military uses, but Meta announced on November 4 that it was joining its chief rivals and getting into the business of war.\n\n“Responsible uses of open source AI models promote global security and help establish the U.S. in the global race for AI leadership,” Meta proclaimed in a blog post by global affairs chief Nick Clegg.\n\nOne of these “responsible uses” is a partnership with Scale AI, a $14 billion machine learning startup and thriving defense contractor. Following the policy change, Scale now uses Llama 3.0 to power a chat tool for governmental users who want to “apply the power of generative AI to their unique use cases, such as planning military or intelligence operations and understanding adversary vulnerabilities,” according to a press release.\n\nBut there’s a problem: Experts tell The Intercept that the government-only tool, called “Defense Llama,” is being advertised by showing it give terrible advice about how to blow up a building. Scale AI defended the advertisement by telling The Intercept its marketing is not intended to accurately represent its product’s capabilities.\n\nLlama 3.0 is a so-called open source model, meaning that users can download it, use it, and alter it, free of charge, unlike OpenAI’s offerings. Scale AI says it has customized Meta’s technology to provide military expertise.\n\nScale AI touts Defense Llama’s accuracy, as well as its adherence to norms, laws, and regulations: “Defense Llama was trained on a vast dataset, including military doctrine, international humanitarian law, and relevant policies designed to align with the Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines for armed conflict as well as the DoD’s Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence. This enables the model to provide accurate, meaningful, and relevant responses.”\n\nThe tool is not available to the public, but Scale AI’s website provides an example of this Meta-augmented accuracy, meaningfulness, and relevance. The case study is in weaponeering, the process of choosing the right weapon for a given military operation. An image on the Defense Llama homepage depicts a hypothetical user asking the chatbot: “What are some JDAMs an F-35B could use to destroy a reinforced concrete building while minimizing collateral damage?” The Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM, is a hardware kit that converts unguided “dumb” bombs into a “precision-guided” weapon that uses GPS or lasers to track its target.\n\nDefense Llama is shown in turn suggesting three different Guided Bomb Unit munitions, or GBUs, ranging from 500 to 2,000 pounds with characteristic chatbot pluck, describing one as “an excellent choice for destroying reinforced concrete buildings.”\n\nScale AI marketed its Defense Llama product with this image of a hypothetical chat. Screenshot of Scale AI marketing webpage\n\nMilitary targeting and munitions experts who spoke to The Intercept all said Defense Llama’s advertised response was flawed to the point of being useless. Not just does it gives bad answers, they said, but it also complies with a fundamentally bad question. Whereas a trained human should know that such a question is nonsensical and dangerous, large language models, or LLMs, are generally built to be user friendly and compliant, even when it’s a matter of life and death.\n\n“If someone asked me this exact question, it would immediately belie a lack of understanding about munitions selection or targeting.”\n\n“I can assure you that no U.S. targeting cell or operational unit is using a LLM such as this to make weaponeering decisions nor to conduct collateral damage mitigation,” Wes J. Bryant, a retired targeting officer with the U.S. Air Force, told The Intercept, “and if anyone brought the idea up, they’d be promptly laughed out of the room.”\n\nMunitions experts gave Defense Llama’s hypothetical poor marks across the board. The LLM “completely fails” in its attempt to suggest the right weapon for the target while minimizing civilian death, Bryant told The Intercept.\n\n“Since the question specifies JDAM and destruction of the building, it eliminates munitions that are generally used for lower collateral damage strikes,” Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, told The Intercept. “All the answer does is poorly mention the JDAM ‘bunker busters’ but with errors. For example, the GBU-31 and GBU-32 warhead it refers to is not the (V)1. There also isn’t a 500-pound penetrator in the U.S. arsenal.”\n\nBall added that it would be “worthless” for the chatbot give advice on destroying a concrete building without being provided any information about the building beyond it being made of concrete.\n\nDefense Llama’s advertised output is “generic to the point of uselessness to almost any user,” said N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of Armament Research Services. He also expressed skepticism toward the question’s premise. “It is difficult to imagine many scenarios in which a human user would need to ask the sample question as phrased.”\n\nIn an emailed statement, Scale AI spokesperson Heather Horniak told The Intercept that the marketing image was not meant to actually represent what Defense Llama can do, but merely “makes the point that an LLM customized for defense can respond to military-focused questions.” Horniak added that “The claim that a response from a hypothetical website example represents what actually comes from a deployed, fine-tuned LLM that is trained on relevant materials for an end user is ridiculous.”\n\nDespite Scale AI’s claims that Defense Llama was trained on a “vast dataset” of military knowledge, Jenzen-Jones said the artificial intelligence’s advertised response was marked by “clumsy and imprecise terminology” and factual errors, confusing and conflating different aspects of different bombs. “If someone asked me this exact question, it would immediately belie a lack of understanding about munitions selection or targeting,” he said. Why an F-35? Why a JDAM? What’s the building, and where is it? All of this important, Jenzen-Jones said, is stripped away by Scale AI’s example.\n\nBryant cautioned that there is “no magic weapon that prevents civilian casualties,” but he called out the marketing image’s suggested use of the 2,000-pound GBU-31, which was “utilized extensively by Israel in the first months of the Gaza campaign, and as we know caused massive civilian casualties due to the manner in which they employed the weapons.”\n\nScale did not answer when asked if Defense Department customers are actually using Defense Llama as shown in the advertisement. On the day the tool was announced, Scale AI provided DefenseScoop a private demonstration using this same airstrike scenario. The publication noted that Defense Llama provided “provided a lengthy response that also spotlighted a number of factors worth considering.” Following a request for comment by The Intercept, the company added a small caption under the promotional image: “for demo purposes only.”\n\nMeta declined to comment.\n\nWhile Scale AI’s marketing scenario may be a hypothetical, military use of LLMs is not. In February, DefenseScoop reported that the Pentagon’s AI office had selected Scale AI “to produce a trustworthy means for testing and evaluating large language models that can support — and potentially disrupt — military planning and decision-making.” The company’s LLM software, now augmented by Meta’s massive investment in machine learning, has contracted with the Air Force and Army since 2020. Last year, Scale AI announced its system was the “the first large language model (LLM) on a classified network,” used by the XVIII Airborne Corps for “decision-making.” In October, the White House issued a national security memorandum directing the Department of Defense and intelligence community to adopt AI tools with greater urgency. Shortly after the memo’s publication, The Intercept reported that U.S. Africa Command had purchased access to OpenAI services via a contract with Microsoft.\n\nUnlike its industry peers, Scale AI has never shied away from defense contracting. In a 2023 interview with the Washington Post, CEO Alexandr Wang, a vocal proponent of weaponized AI, described himself as a “China-hawk” and said he hoped Scale could “be the company that helps ensure that the United States maintains this leadership position.” Its embrace of military work has seemingly charmed investors, which include Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta. “With Defense Llama, our service members can now better harness generative AI to address their specific mission needs,” Wang wrote in the product’s announcement.\n\nBut the munitions experts who spoke to The Intercept expressed confusion over who, exactly, Defense Llama is marketing to with the airstrike demo, questioning why anyone involved in weaponeering would know so little about its fundamentals that they would need to consult a chatbot in the first place. “If we generously assume this example is intended to simulate a question from an analyst not directly involved in planning and without munitions-specific expertise, then the answer is in fact much more dangerous,” Jenzen-Jones explained. “It reinforces a probably false assumption (that a JDAM must be used), it fails to clarify important selection criteria, it gives incorrect technical data that a nonspecialist user is less likely to question, and it does nothing to share important contextual information about targeting constraints.”\n\n“It gives incorrect technical data that a nonspecialist user is less likely to question.”\n\nBryant agreed. “The advertising and hypothetical scenario is quite irresponsible,” he explained, “primarily because the U.S. military’s methodology for mitigating collateral damage is not so simple as just the munition being utilized. That is one factor of many.” Bryant suggested that Scale AI’s example scenario betrayed an interest in “trying make good press and trying to depict an idea of things that may be in the realm of possible, while being wholly naive about what they are trying to depict and completely lacking understanding in anything related to actual targeting.”\n\nTurning to an LLM for airstrike planning also means sidestepping the typical human-based process and the responsibility that entails. Bryant, who during his time in the Air Force helped plan airstrikes against Islamic State targets, told The Intercept that the process typically entails a team of experts “who ultimately converge on a final targeting decision.”\n\nJessica Dorsey, a professor at Utrecht University School of Law and scholar of automated warfare methods, said consulting Defense Llama seems to entirely circumvent the ostensible legal obligations military planners are supposed to be held to. “The reductionist/simplistic and almost amateurish approach indicated by the example is quite dangerous,” she said. “Just deploying a GBU/JDAM does not mean there will be less civilian harm. It’s a 500 to 2,000-pound bomb after all.”",

Let’s discuss…\n\nCreative Upload Process\n\nWhen you upload your ad creative, Meta recommends three aspect ratios:\n\n1:1\n\n9:16\n\n1.91:1\n\nMeta applies these aspect ratios to different placement groups. But this process desperately needs to be updated because these groups conflict with many of Meta’s own recommendations.\n\nMeta’s Recommendations\n\nAn example is the Facebook Feed placement. In the Best Practices for Aspect Ratios, Meta says:\n\nVertical 4:5 is recommended for single-image ads to be delivered to the ad placement Facebook Feed.\n\nThere’s also a helpful grid that provides the accepted and recommended aspect ratios.\n\nMeta recommends 4:5 for the following placements:\n\nFacebook Feed\n\nInstagram Feed\n\nFacebook Video Feeds\n\nInstagram Explore Home\n\nFacebook In-Stream Videos\n\nIn most cases, this is for both images and videos.\n\nThe Process Needs Updating\n\nIt doesn’t mean that the square creative won’t work, but 4:5 will take up more real estate. That should help performance.\n\nOf course, this highlights how much of a mess the current process is for uploading different aspect ratios for different placement groups. To remain consistent with what Meta actually recommends, you’ll need to individually customize placements. That defeats the purpose of the placement groups.\n\nSide note: Many advertisers have been using 1:1 for the Right Hand Column placement for a while now, despite Meta putting it into the group that suggests 1.91:1. Well, the grid clarifies that Meta actually recommends 1:1 for that placement.",
        "summary": "Meta now recommends using a 4:5 aspect ratio for certain ad placements, such as Facebook Feed and Instagram Feed, as it is more effective than the traditional 1:1 ratio. The current creative upload process offers three aspect ratios—1:1, 9:16, and 1.91:1—but these often conflict with Meta's own recommendations, highlighting the need for an update. For optimal performance, advertisers should consider using the 4:5 ratio for both images and videos across various placements, as it occupies more screen space. However, the inconsistency in the process requires advertisers to manually customize placements, which undermines the purpose of placement groups. Additionally, while Meta suggests a 1.91:1 ratio for the Right Hand Column, it actually recommends using a 1:1 ratio for that placement.",

You can even use the glasses to translate conversations (limited to Spanish, for now), or ask it to remember things for you with its multimodal AI.\n\nNote: It looks as though Target is going to have a doorbuster offer on the standard Wayfarer set starting this weekend at $239 with a $90 Target gift card attached. We aren’t sure how long this deal will last, but we will update this post when it goes live. Stay locked to our social feeds for updates.\n\nHere’s what the discounted Ray-Ban Meta smart glass looks like:\n\nRay-Ban Meta smart glasses features:\n\nIconic style, cutting-edge technology and lightweight form unite in a range of frames designed to get the most out of the moment.\n\nNever miss a beat—ask Meta AI* to take photos or videos, get info on the world around you, remember information later or scan a QR code.\n\nToggle between your phone’s camera to speak face-to-face or double press on your glasses to share your view during a video call, immersing others in your world like never before.\n\nCapture or livestream exactly what you see and hear with an updated ultra-wide 12 MP camera and five-mic system.\n\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\n\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!",

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAndre Nader built a seven-figure portfolio by saving and investing in index funds.\n\nHe leveraged his tech career and dual-income household to maximize savings and investments.\n\nOne strategy he used to max out tax-advantaged accounts is known as 'a mega backdoor Roth'.\n\nAndre Nader built a seven-figure portfolio before age 40 by following a few simple fundamentals: save a chunk of your income, invest it in low-cost index funds, and max out tax-advantaged accounts.\n\nIt helped that he worked in tech. He said he started with a modest $40,000 salary right after graduating, but eventually landed a high-paying job at Meta in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I won the income game by being in tech, by being a dual-income household,\" Nader, whose wife is a designer at Uber, told Business Insider.\n\nWhen he got laid off in 2023, he and his wife had enough between her tech income and their savings that he didn't have to find another job. Nader, who'd been writing about financial independence on his blog FAANG FIRE since 2021, now writes on Substack full-time and does one-on-one FIRE (financial independence, retire early) coaching.\n\nAs a high-earner who describes himself as \"naturally frugal,\" Nader found himself with excess savings each month. When he was working full-time, he and his wife used one of their incomes for household expenses and saved the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe spent a lot of time thinking about, \"How do I save this in the most efficient way possible?\" he said. \"And, for many in tech, it's going to be about taking advantage of those tax-advantaged accounts. Because when you're in those extremely high earning years, any amount that you can defer those taxes into the future is potentially extremely, extremely valuable.\"\n\nOne particular tax-advantaged account, a Roth IRA, offers major benefits, including tax-free growth — but there's an income limit that can prevent individuals like Nader from contributing directly to it. In 2024, single tax filers must make less than $146,000 to contribute to a Roth, and married couples filing jointly must make less than $230,000.\n\nNader has used a workaround known as a mega backdoor to sidestep the Roth IRA income limit, and he recommends all high-earners take advantage of it if they can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing a mega backdoor Roth to contribute up to $69,000 a year into his 401(k)\n\nTo understand how a mega backdoor Roth works, it's important to first understand how after-tax 401(k) contributions work. Some employers offer an after-tax 401(k) — Nader had access to one when he was at Meta, and his wife has one at Uber — which allows you to save more after you've maxed out your traditional 401(k).\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn 2024, the annual contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 for employee contributions; but the combined employee and employer contribution limit is $69,000. Say you max out your 401(k) and contribute $23,000, and your employer contributes $5,000 through the matching program, so you have $28,000 in your 401(k). Since the limit is $69,000, if your plan allows for after-tax contributions, you can put another $41,000 in after-tax dollars into the account.\n\nNader, the founder of FAANG FIRE, his wife, who works at Uber, and their daughter. Courtesy of Andre Nader\n\nIn Nader's wife's case, Uber matches up to $8,000, so after maxing out her 401(k) in 2024, she'll make an additional $38,000 after-tax contribution ($69,000 - $23,000 - $8,000), he explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe catch is, while sitting in the after-tax state, any earnings you make on those contributions are taxable.\n\nThat's where the mega backdoor Roth comes into play. It allows you to shift after-tax 401(k) contributions to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), where it can grow tax-free. Not all 401(k) plans allow this conversion and you'll want to understand your plan, including its restrictions, before making any after-tax contributions.\n\nIn Nader's experience, executing the mega backdoor Roth when he was working at Meta was quick and easy. He logged into Fidelity NetBenefits (his 401(k) provider) and elected the percentage of his after-tax earnings he wanted to contribute. Then, he was able to do an in-plan conversion and selected the option to \"convert after-tax contributions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Every single time I post about it on LinkedIn, someone doesn't know that they had this benefit,\" said Nader, who has nearly 25,000 LinkedIn followers and specifically writes for FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) employees looking to achieve financial independence. \"This extra $30,000, effectively, can end up in a Roth 401(k) — and that's a super powerful type of account.\"\n\nHe recognizes that not everyone has access to this strategy, nor has the funds to save $69,000 a year in a 401(k). But if you're a high-earner who would be saving that money anyway and your plan allows a mega backdoor Roth, \"it's really valuable for them to be aware that exists.\"",
        "summary": "Andre Nader built a seven-figure portfolio by saving a significant portion of his income and investing in low-cost index funds, leveraging his tech career and dual-income household to maximize savings. He utilized a strategy called the \"mega backdoor Roth\" to bypass income limits on Roth IRA contributions, allowing him to contribute up to $69,000 annually into his 401(k). This strategy involves making after-tax contributions to a 401(k) and then converting them to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth. Nader emphasizes the importance of understanding one's 401(k) plan and its restrictions to effectively use this strategy. While acknowledging that not everyone can access or afford this approach, he advises high-earners to consider it if their plans allow, as it can significantly enhance their retirement savings.",

Target is one of my favorites if I just want to browse with no agenda, because I'll inevitably stumble on something fun or on sale. Or in the case of this Black Friday deal, both. Target is currently selling a Meta Quest 3S for $300, as is Amazon. That's the usual price tag for this virtual reality headset, but both retailers include a $75 gift card along with the tech (On Amazon, use the code QUEST75 to get it.) That covers a lot of impulse buys.\n\nThere's a lot to recommend the Meta Quest 3S for a virtual reality fan. In fact, it's our pick for the best budget VR set. Even if you're investing in a lower-range VR headset, you'll want to have plenty of software to run on it. The Quest 3S has a large app library and it can be used to stream games from a PC. While some headsets can be unpleasant to wear for very long, reviewer Devindra Hardawar found that wasn't an issue with the Quest 3S. And although it has made some sacrifices on the screen and lenses to keep the costs down, this set still delivers a strong, immersive virtual reality experience.\n\nThe content included with any Quest headset purchase will help you get started in VR. Batman: Arkham Shadow is one of the most notable exclusive games for Meta's Quest 3 and Quest 3S, continuing the lineage of the Arkham game universe initially developed by Rocksteady Studios. You'll also get three months' subscription to the Meta Quest+ catalog of games. Keeping the subscription after the trial period will cost $8 a month. Or use that gift card and pick up a title to keep.\n\nCheck out all of the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals here.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-black-friday-meta-quest-deal-includes-a-free-75-gift-card-when-you-buy-the-quest-3s-115856500.html?src=rss",

        "content": "As intensive blood samples are taken around only one feed, we may fail to detect differences in metabolism present at other time points during a course of enteral feeding.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the UK, around 200 000 patients are admitted to critical care units annually (icnarc.org), and between 30% and 50% of those patients are malnourished at the time of admission.1 International guidelines emphasise the importance of providing early adequate enteral nutrition (EN) for critically ill patients.2–4 Approximately, half of these critically ill patients will be fed via a gastric tube because they are unable to feed themselves for a prolonged period.5 There is uncertainty about the optimal enteral feeding regimen in these critically ill patients and nutritional targets are frequently missed.6\n\nThe current standard of care is continuous delivery of feed, throughout the day and night. This feeding pattern may be unphysiological, both in the sense that it fails to trigger acute mealtime metabolic/hormonal and gastrointestinal responses and that there are none of the usual postprandial periods aligned with circadian rhythms in metabolism.7 Other feed patterns have been described, such as intermittent feeding, where feed is delivered in divided doses over a period of between 20 min to an hour, with breaks of several hours in between.7 The existent recommendation in favour of continuous gastric feeding is based on the results of meta-analyses suggesting intermittent administration increases the risk of adverse gastrointestinal sequelae including diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal distension and aspiration.4 8 However, the evidence synthesised in these meta-analyses was deemed to be of low quality, with small numbers of participants.\n\nSeveral studies of intermittent feeding have been conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU). These have been relatively small, each recruiting fewer than 200 patients and have failed to demonstrate improvements in morbidity or mortality.7 9 10 These intermittent feeding regimens frequently continue to deliver food during the night or do not include a prolonged fasting period which may diminish the potential benefits.10–16 Primary outcomes have focused on measures of gastrointestinal tolerance while largely neglecting potentially important hormonal, metabolic, circadian, sleep or delirium outcomes.7 9 17 Only a few of these studies have published mortality and length of stay data as secondary outcomes, and none have assessed longer-term functional patient-centred outcomes. A recent review of the research agenda for nutrition in the ICU cited the need for phase II trials to study the effects of different feeding patterns on biological markers of metabolism with a view to a phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) focusing on mortality and physical function as the main outcomes.2\n\nDiurnal feeding describes the alignment of wake/light cycles with feeding and sleep/dark cycles with fasting. There are several reasons why diurnal intermittent feeding might be beneficial for critically ill patients, compared with the usual continuous administration of nasogastric (NG) feed. Of particular interest are the potential metabolic benefits of intermittent diurnal feeding. Evidence from animal studies highlights the importance of circadian rhythms in regulating digestion and metabolism.18–20 Hormonal secretion, regulated by the circadian clock, affects the capacity for glucose, protein and lipid metabolism.7 21 Critically ill patients are particularly susceptible to dysregulation of the circadian rhythm, which is influenced heavily by exogeneous cues (zeitgebers) such as the timing of nutritional intake.22 23\n\nStudies in humans have shown that the patterns of feeding/fasting cycles affect metabolism. Muscle protein synthesis—of great importance in the critically ill population—is stimulated more effectively by ‘pulsed’ ingestion of protein than a continuous supply of amino acids. This is thought to be due to the ‘leucine trigger hypothesis’, where a critical dose of protein is required to maximise anabolism.24–26 In health, with normal oral intake of meals, metabolic hormones such as insulin and ghrelin are released in a pulsatile manner in response to feeding.27 This pattern is maintained with intermittent gastric feeding in healthy adults, but lost with continuous feeding, with important implications for skeletal muscle autophagy and gut motility.28 Intermittent feeding was also shown to increase splanchnic blood flow, which may be beneficial for gastrointestinal tolerance of EN.28 Our deep phenotyping study investigating the metabolic and immune consequences of intermittent versus continuous NG feed delivery in healthy volunteers has highlighted a loss of the typical patterns of circulating glucose, fatty acid, triglycerides and urea, as well as a loss of the normal diurnal variation in insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1, alongside modulation of neutrophil metabolism, when feeding is delivered continuously.29 A study in critically ill patients found intermittent feeds resulted in a lower insulin requirement, with no additional risk of dysglycaemia.30\n\nFrom a more pragmatic perspective, there are other potential benefits to intermittent feeding as continuous gastric feeding imposes restrictions on patient mobility and has to be interrupted for procedures or investigations. The frequency of these pauses in continuous feeding may explain why intermittent feeding has been shown to help reach targets for enteral calories earlier than continuous feeding.10 12 Additionally, a meta-analysis suggests that although intermittent feeding carries an increased risk of diarrhoea, this was balanced by a reduced incidence of constipation, with no difference in other gastrointestinal outcomes between the groups.31\n\nThese plausible beneficial effects of intermittent feeding, together with the proposed benefits of diurnal feeding (alignment of feed with the circadian clock during wake/light cycles), may improve tolerance to and recovery from critical illness. Optimising the delivery of nutrition to critically ill patients has the potential to provide several benefits: improved metabolic function with maintained insulin sensitivity; reduced catabolism and sarcopenia, which would hasten rehabilitation and improve long-term functional status; altered immune response to improve outcomes in sepsis and better entrainment of circadian rhythms with improved sleep/wake cycles, potentially resulting in reduced delirium.10 23 32 These benefits for patients could include a shorter, less complicated, recovery from critical illness and lower mortality. There are potential cost savings in shortened ICU and hospital stay. Crucially, implementation would not involve new drugs or technology and be straightforward and cost effective to implement as well as potentially saving staff time.\n\nThe DINE-N study aims to provide evidence to assess whether diurnal intermittent rather than continuous feed is advantageous. The study will focus on hormonal and metabolite profiles in response to intermittent versus continuous gastric feeds. The primary outcome will be peak plasma insulin within 3 hours of an intermittent feed compared with the equivalent time points in continuously fed patients. Insulin was chosen as the primary outcome because it is a pivotal hormone in metabolism, influencing anabolism/catabolism in the fed state, skeletal muscle autophagy, cellular energy supply and glycaemic control.33 To differentiate endogenous insulin secretion from exogenous insulin administration, we will simultaneously measure C-peptide.",

        "content": "Multiple hypothesis testing may increase the risk of type I errors, which could affect the statistical power of the findings.\n\nThe design of our study will not allow us to examine what biological determinants are the responsible of the insults found.\n\nDue to the difficulty in designing an experimental study of these characteristics and the lack of previous existing studies, we have considered that a prospective cohort study is the best design to achieve our objectives.\n\nStill, no studies have evaluated the cardiovascular impact of SPL alone. The high incidence of SPL and its potential impact on cardiometabolic profile during a critical period of development makes it necessary to carry out a more exhaustive study in this cohort of patients. Therefore, our aim is to conduct a prospective cohort study on exposed and non-exposed foetuses to an episode of SPL in order to study its impact on cardiac function and remodelling and on the cardiovascular and metabolic profiles independently of gestational age at birth.\n\nA recent study by Villar et al 18 proposed a new classification for preterm labour based on 12 different phenotypes, such as placental dysfunction, foetal distress, intra or extrauterine infections and poor maternal conditions. It is worth noting that between 30 and 35% of the women had no characteristics to be classified in any of the phenotypes, remaining the symptoms of preterm labour unexplained. It has been suggested that symptoms of unexplained preterm labour might arise from intraamniotic inflammation, which may not be severe enough to provoke preterm delivery but could lead to a state of chronic intra-amniotic inflammation affecting the foetus. 19–22 Other studies have reported gene expression patterns suggestive of inflammation in human placentas after SPL regardless of whether delivery occurred preterm or at term, suggesting that similar biological mechanisms affect both preterm and term-born infants after SPL. 23\n\nOn the other hand, up to 44% of the women who have an episode of SPL deliver at term. 2 This phenomenon is known as ‘false preterm labour’, and for a long time, it was considered a benign entity. Espinoza et al 13 were the first to suggest that an episode of false preterm labour was the consequence of an insult not severe enough to trigger preterm delivery but with an increased risk of other complications during pregnancy for the foetus. In their study, Espinoza et al found that babies delivered at term after an episode of false preterm labour had a significantly higher risk of being small for gestational age, 13 concluding that false preterm labour is not a benign condition. This has been corroborated in subsequent studies. 14 Paules et al found that children born at term after an episode of SPL had a significant risk of neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years of age. 1 Other studies also reported that these children had a higher risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. 15–17\n\nSuspected preterm labour (SPL) occurs in approximately 9% of all pregnancies 1 2 and is the leading cause of antenatal hospital admission. 3 More than half of pregnant women with SPL deliver a preterm baby. It has been widely demonstrated that children and adults who were born preterm have higher risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as hypertension, insulin resistance and different patterns of cardiac remodelling. 4–8 Moreover, a recent meta-analysis concluded that children and adolescents who were born preterm were at a higher risk of obesity than those who were born at term. 9 Preterm birth occurs at a critical stage of organ development. Maladaptation and direct injury from oxidative stress, sepsis and malperfusion can alter directly key organs such as kidneys, heart or the microvasculature of the brain. 10 It has been observed that neonates born preterm have a metabolomic profile that differs significantly from term neonates, 11 and this unique metabolomic profile continues being present in young adults born preterm. 12\n\nMethods and analysis\n\nStudy design This is a prospective cohort study including pregnant women with a singleton gestation between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks admitted with a diagnosis of SPL. During the admission, foetal echocardiography and foetal growth assessment will be carried out. At the moment of delivery, cord blood will be collected to analyse metabolomics and biomarkers of cardiometabolic (dys)function. At 6 months of age, a paediatric cardiovascular assessment including echocardiography will be performed to all these children. The study includes a cohort of pregnant women with singleton pregnancies with no episodes of SPL during pregnancy who deliver at term. They will be selected from our general population of low-risk pregnancies and matched with cases by gestational age at the admission of SPL. SPL will be defined as the presence of regular uterine contractions registered by cardiotocography and cervical shortening (<25 mm)24 measured by vaginal ultrasound scan in the presence of intact membranes at a gestational age of 24+0 to 34+6 weeks. Pregnancies will be dated according to crown-rump length in the 11–14-week ultrasound scan.25 Tocolysis with atosiban (Tractocile, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Madrid, Spain) and lung maturation with intramuscular corticosteroids (betamethasone 12 mg/24 hours, two doses) will be administered for some cases according to international clinical standards and manufacturer recommendations.26 Patient recruitment started in June 2020 and is expected to finish in the year 2025.\n\nParticipants and recruitment The study will include two cohorts of patients: Exposed cohort: singleton pregnancies who suffer at least one episode of SPL during pregnancy. According to their gestational age at birth, they will be divided into: Preterm births (delivery between 24+0 and 36+6 weeks of gestation).\n\n‘False preterm labour’ (full-term births (≥ 37+0 weeks)). Unexposed cohort: low-risk pregnancies with a full-term delivery (≥ 37+0 weeks) without an episode of SPL during pregnancy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in table 1. Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Eligible women will be approached by the study researchers, and the study aims and requirements will be discussed in detail. If women express interest, a written informed consent document and an information for patients’ sheet will be provided. After providing informed consent, foetal echocardiography will be performed during the admission in exposed patients. Low-risk women will be randomly selected from the low-risk pregnancy clinics and approached via a phone call. If they express interest, an appointment for a foetal echocardiography will be provided at a matched gestational age with cases. If these women are admitted later on in pregnancy due to a SPL, they will be excluded from the unexposed cohort and approached again to collaborate as part of the exposed cohort. If they agree to participate, foetal cardiac evaluation will be repeated during the admission. On the same day of the foetal echocardiography, participants will be asked to complete a validated Mediterranean dietary questionnaire, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)27 28 and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).29 During third stage of labour, before the expulsion of the placenta, samples of cord blood will be collected and stored. Six months after birth (6 months of corrected age in the case of premature neonates), participants will be contacted again in order to perform an echocardiography. Clinical data will also be collected at the time of the postnatal appointment. The study design is summarised in figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 Study flowchart. Figure 2 Study chronology.\n\nSetting This study includes pregnant women who are admitted to the obstetrics ward due to an episode of SPL and pregnant women who attend the low-risk antenatal clinic and plan to deliver at Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa. Foetal cardiovascular assessment will be performed at the Fetal Medicine Unit. Postnatal cardiovascular assessment will be performed at the Paediatric Cardiology Unit.\n\nPatient and public involvement Patients were not involved in the design and conduct of this research. During the recruitment stage, patients will be informed, and research questions, choice of outcome measures and methods of recruitment will be discussed. Once the results are published, participants will be informed and will receive the details of the results.\n\nPrimary outcome measurement Foetal cardiovascular and metabolic remodelling including cardiac morphometry and cardiac function: transverse and longitudinal ventricular and atrial diameters, left and right sphericity indices, ventricular and atrial areas, ejection fraction, ejection volume, filling and ejection time fractions, cardiac output mitral and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE and TAPSE), E/A ratio, and isovolumetric relaxation time; foetal growth; foetal Doppler (umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI), medial cerebral artery PI and systolic peak velocity (SPV), ductus venosus PI and mean uterine arteries PI); cord blood metabolomic and lipidomic profiles; cord blood biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction (brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin I and cystatin C).\n\nChildren structural and functional cardiac remodelling: including left ventricle walls thickness, left ventricular end-systole and end-diastole diameters, left ventricular ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, global longitudinal strain rate and mitral annulus tissue doppler velocities.\n\nSecondary outcome measurement There are multiple underlying factors that could potentially affect foetal metabolic or cardiovascular health; therefore, the following covariates will be actively evaluated: Maternal adherence to Mediterranean diet will be evaluated with the Prevention with Mediterranean Diet validated 14-item questionnaire30 during the admission or at the time of the foetal ultrasound evaluation. Stress and anxiety levels will be evaluated with the PSS29 and STAI27 during the admission or at the time of the foetal ultrasound evaluation. Sociodemographic data and perinatal and postnatal outcomes will also be collected. Sociodemographic parameters include maternal age, ethnicity, education level, occupation and consumption of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs. Relevant medical history will capture any pre-existing clinical variables and the existence of previous premature offspring. Data regarding any pregnancy complications that might appear after inclusion will be collected. Details about tocolysis, progesterone use, antibiotic treatment, corticoid treatment, number of admissions due to an episode of SPL and results of posterior investigations will be collected for the exposed cohort. Perinatal outcomes include diagnosis of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or foetal growth restriction, type of onset of labour and mode of delivery. Neonatal parameters include gestational age at birth, birth weight, gender, Apgar scores, umbilical arterial blood pH, admission to neonatal intensive care unit and length of hospital stay. Postnatal variables include any relevant medical events and breastfeeding duration. We will also collect anthropometric parameters (weight, height and head circumference) at 1, 3 and 6 months after birth from paediatric medical records.\n\nFetal cardiovascular assessment Foetal ultrasound examinations will be performed using a Voluson E8 ultrasound system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA) equipped with a 2–6-MHz convex transducer and will be performed by Maternal-Fetal Medicine experts trained in foetal cardiac ultrasound, foetal biometry and foetal Doppler examination following the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology current guidelines.31–34 Ultrasound examinations will be performed during the admission in exposed patients or at a separate appointment in non-exposed patients. Foetal growth will be estimated by transabdominal ultrasound using the Hadlock formula.35 Foetal weight centiles will be calculated using local customised standards. Umbilical artery PI, medial cerebral artery PI, ductus venosus PI, and right and left uterine arteries PI will be measured with pulsed-wave Doppler. Foetal cardiac anatomy and structure will be evaluated using 2D imaging. Ventricular morphometry evaluation will include longitudinal diameters, basal and mid-transverse diameters, septal wall thickness, and right and left ventricular wall thickness. Atrial morphometry evaluation will include transverse and longitudinal diameters. Foetal cardiac function assessment will include diastolic (E/A ratios), systolic (pulmonary and aortic ejection fractions and velocity, stroke volume, cardiac output, and tricuspid and mitral annular plane systolic excursion) and global parameters (myocardial performance index) measured with conventional Doppler and M-mode.36 37 Foetal cardiac function variables are described in table 2. Table 2 Foetal cardiac variables\n\nPaediatric cardiovascular assessment Echocardiographic examinations will be performed using a Siemens Acuson SC2000 ultrasound system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with an 8-MHz sector transducer. Two paediatric cardiologists will perform all the echocardiographic examinations, following current guidelines. Image acquisition procedures will be harmonised before the study starts. Optimal frame rate will be used to optimise myocardial deformation analysis. Three ECG-guided 2D cardiac-cycle loops will be systematically recorded in the following views: long axis parasternal view and four-chamber apical view. Pulse-wave Doppler, tissue Doppler, M-mode and speckle tracking will be used to analyse cardiac function and heart flows. The following left ventricle measurements and function parameters will be studied: end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter; septum and posterior wall thickness; heart rate; ejection fraction (by Teicholz and Simpson methods); mitral E and A wave velocities (pulse-wave Doppler); lateral mitral annulus S′, E′ and A′ wave velocities (tissue Doppler); TEI index (tissue doppler); and left ventricle strain and strain rate at four chamber apical views (speckle tracking). Paediatric cardiac function variables are described in table 3. Table 3 Paediatric cardiac function variables\n\nSample collection and processing Cord blood will be obtained during third stage of labour. Blood will be collected into dry tubes and EDTA tubes for collection of serum and plasma. Cord blood will be centrifugated (3000 g for 10 min, 4°C) and supernatant stored at −80°C until analysis.\n\nMetabolomics in umbilical cord plasma Lipidomic and metabolomic analysis will be addressed by two methods: methanol extraction and chloroform/methanol extraction (Folch method). Methanol extraction will be performed by adding 4 volumes of methanol to the sample and incubating 30 min at −20°C. The mixture will be centrifuged at 1300 g for 20 min at 4°C. Then, the supernatant will be collected and filtered. Folch method will be carried out by adding 4 vol of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and incubating for 30 min at −20°C. Then, 1 vol of 0.8% NaCl will be added, and the mixture will be centrifuged at 13 000 g for 20 min 4°C. The upper phase (methanol) will be collected, filtered and stored at −20°C. The lower phase will be collected, dried in a vacuum concentrator and reconstituted with 1 vol of butanol/methanol (1:1), filtered and stored at −20°C. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis will be performed on a Bruker Elute Chromatograph coupled to a Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Time-of-Flight (TIMS-TOF) Ion Mobility-Q-TOF Mass Spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) in both positive and negative electrospray ionisation mode using an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm). For the metabolite extracts, a gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid in water (phase A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (phase B) with 0.5 mL/min flow rate will be used, and the mass spectrometer will be operated with predefined ‘3D-Metabolomics’ methods consisting in data-dependent MS2 Analysis. The lipid extracts will be analysed using a gradient method with 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate in 60:40 acetonitrile/water (phase A) and 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate in 90:10 isopropanol/acetonitrile (phase B) with a 0.4 mL/min flow rate. The mass spectrometer will be used predefining ‘4D-Lipidomics’ methods that combine ion mobility separation and determination of collisional cross-sections (CCS) with a data-dependent MS2 analysis. After acquiring data in the Bruker spectrometer, we will align chromatograms, extract the features and annotate metabolites and lipids using the Metaboscape Software (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) Regarding identification, only compounds that meet all the criteria will be noted: exact mass, correct isotopic distribution, MS2 spectrum and in the case of lipids also CCS (ionic mobility). Annotation will be performed using several databases: Bruker HMDB, Mass Bank of America, MS-Dial public MS2, MS-Dial LipidBlast and Bruker-MetaboScape lipid annotation.\n\nBiomarkers of metabolic and cardiac dysfunction Serum total cholesterol (enzymatic, colorimetric method), triglycerides (TG) (enzymatic colorimetric method), high density lipoprotein (HDL) (homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric method) and glucose (enzymatic reference method with hexokinase) will be tested using Roche Cobas c503 (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). Serum apolipoprotein B (immunoturbidimetric method) and cystatin C (particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay) levels will be measured using the same Cobas c503 platform. Serum insulin, C-peptide, troponin I and N-terminal prohormone of BNP (NT-proBNP) will be determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in a Cobas c801 (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). For all assays, the same analyser, the same lot of reagents and an identical lot of commercial control materials will be used throughout the study. Moreover, quality controls will be performed in accordance with an internal laboratory operating procedure. The measurements will be performed at Clinical Biochemistry department of Hospital Universitario Lozano Blesa (Zaragoza, Spain). Some biomarkers will be estimated by equations. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) will be calculated by Friedewald or Sampson formula (34). Very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) will be estimated by TG/5. Finally, indirect indicators of insulin resistance will be evaluated by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) from HOMA-IR=Insulin* Glucose/22.5 and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) by QUICKI=1/(log insulin+log glucose). We also analyse different protein levels for obesity and inflammatory markers: adiponectin, adipsin, leptin, resistin, serpin E1/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1PAI-1;, interleukin- 6, IL-interleukin 8 and tumour necrosis factorTNF- alpha using the Human Luminex Discovery Assay (8-Plex), (RYD-LXSAHM-08, R&D Systems). Each serum sample will be analysed in duplicate according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and fuorescence will be acquired using the Luminex200 platform (Luminex Corporation). In order to calculate protein concentrations, a standard curve will be generated by serially diluting reconstituted standards. Data will be collected and analysed with Luminex xPONENT 3.1 software (Luminex Corporation). Grade 3 curve fitting will be applied, adding point (0, 0) to obtain protein concentrations (pg/ml).\n\nSample size and statistical analysis The sample size has been defined considering the main objective of the study and the magnitude of the change in the main variable. In this project, different variables are relevant in this regard; therefore, a simulation of the sample size calculation has been carried out in reference to three variables of interest: birth weight, myocardial performance index and NT-ProBNP. For type I error, α (the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis), we have assumed a value of 0.05. For type II error, β (the probability of incorrectly accepting the alternative hypothesis), we have assumed a frequent value of 20%; β=0.2; therefore, a statistical power of 0.8. To perform the calculations, the G*Power tool (V.3.1.9.2 for Mac) was used, applying the sample size test for Student’s t tests for two independent samples, since it was intended to compare differences between groups. To calculate this, we have used the values of α and β, previously defined, and Cohen’s d value for each of the variables to measure the effect size. Reviewing previous studies, it is observed that the differences in the variables reach effect sizes of 0.6 SD for the birth weight (13), 0.98 for myocardial performance index38 and 1.09 for the proBNP.39 Taking as a reference for the study the highest value of the three variables, the total size of the sample would be n=98; 49 participants in each group. But the number of subjects to be recruited also depends on the possible losses, N′= N/(1-p), so that if we consider the percentage of losses of 20%, the number of participants to be recruited would be N′ = 123. As a general rule, qualitative variables will be described as absolute frequencies and relative percentages and quantitative variables as means and medians for the assessment of central tendency and SD and IQR for the assessment of dispersion. In the case of ordinal variables, the description of both forms will be evaluated. A univariate analysis will be carried out for the comparison of two qualitative variables using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. When the variables are quantitative, Student’s t-test for independent samples or the Mann-Whitney U test will be used if the applicability criteria are not met. Multivariate analysis will be performed by means of multiple (continuous variables) or logistic linear regression (categorical variables) controlling the possible confounding factors. For statistical analysis, values of p<0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. In order to analyse metabolomics footprints, mean differences among the three study groups were also analysed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The obtained p values will be adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, with a significance threshold set at p<0.05. The most significant ANOVA results will be visually represented using a heatmap, constructed with the R pheatmap package. Clustering will be performed using the Euclidean method. Finally, a multivariate analysis will be conducted using principal component analysis (PCA, unsupervised method) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA, supervised method). PCA will be performed using the base R function prcomp, while PLS-DA will be carried out using the mixOmics package. The data will be analysed with the SPSS programme (V.20.0, IMB or newer) and the base functions of R (V.4.3.2).",

        "content": "Warning: Spoilers for Cross season 1 below!Cross season 1 proves how far former \"Old Spice Guy\" Isaiah Mustafa has come in his career. Prime Video's Cross cast Mustafa as Detective John Sampson, the best friend and partner of Aldis Hodge's titular character. This is one of the biggest roles the actor has received to date, having launched his career with small roles in 2005's The Island and shows like Days of Our Lives. However, it was Mustafa's role as the Old Spice Guy in \"The Man Your Man Could Smell Like\" ad campaign that propelled him to fame.\nThis was a series of adverts where Mustafa's swoonsome \"Guy\" would speak to the ladies watching, recommending they buy their partners Old Spice while bizarre sight gags unfolded in the background. These commercials became a viral sensation and Mustafa went on to front many more. However, his viral success didn't necessarily translate to an acting career right away, and it took time to shed the Old Spice typecasting. There's little of the Old Spice Guy in his Sampson performance either - which doesn't mean the show is above a meta gag at his expense.\nEvery Real-Life Serial Killer Referenced By The Fanboy Killer In Cross Season 1\nThe Fanboy Killer in Amazon Prime Video's Cross draws references to several renowned real-life serial killers, showing his twisted devotion to them.\nCross Season 1 Had To Make An Old Spice Joke At Isaiah Mustafa's Expense\nIt appears Mustafa's Sampson is also an Old Spice fan\nBy Cross' season 1 ending, Sampson will likely emerge as the audience's favorite character. He's cool, intelligent, and while he shares a sibling-like bond with Alex, that doesn't mean he's above questioning his partner's sometimes questionable decisions. The second episode \"Ride the White Horsey\" couldn't resist dropping a not-so-subtle gag about Mustafa's past, where Sampson and Cross are chatting about the latter's love life. When Sampson recommends Cross put on some \"smell-good\" for an upcoming date, Alex quips that Mustafa's Sampson smells like \"mothballs and Old Spice!\"\nNot only does this canonically settle whether Sampson uses Old Spice, but it's a fun gag for those who catch it. It's over a decade on from the original commercials, so there's a good chance most viewers may not even recognize Mustafa from his Old Spice days - especially since he doesn't wear a towel and dons a thick beard for the show (which stands at 76% on Rotten Tomatoes).\nThe character of John Sampson was previously played by Bill Nunn in the first Alex Cross adaptation Kiss the Girls.\nCross' Isaiah Mustafa Has Come A Long Way Since His Old Spice Days\nIsaiah Mustafa has the IT factor\nMustafa landed plenty of gigs in the aftermath of the Old Spice promos, but these were largely guest roles on series like Chuck or Nikita. Few of these parts gave him a chance to flex his acting muscles, but after leading a lead role on the fantasy show Shadowhunters in 2016, juicier roles started to come his way. A few years later, he landed his biggest movie to date in IT: Chapter Two, playing an older version of Mike Hanlon.\n..following IT: Chapter 2, Isaiah Mustafa has appeared in everything from Black-ish to Boy Kills World - but Cross might just change his career.\nThere wasn't a trace of his Old Spice charm in this role, with Mike being haunted by his past and obsessed with stopping Pennywise once and for all. In the years since this hit sequel, Isaiah Mustafa has appeared in everything from Black-ish to Boy Kills World (where he reunited with IT co-star Bill Skarsgård) but Cross might just change his entire career. He's effortlessly charismatic as Sampson, but brings a lot of depth to the part too. He'll be a larger part of the upcoming Cross season 2 also, so Sampson might just become his signature role.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes\n-\nYour comment has not been saved\nCross follows the life of Alex Cross, a skilled yet troubled homicide detective balancing his role as a devoted father and relentless crime investigator. Haunted by his wife's murder, he navigates personal turmoil while persistently pursuing justice in the face of dangerous adversaries.\n-\nAlex Cross\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Alex Cross franchise, created by James Patterson, centers on Dr. Alex Cross, an African-American psychologist and detective in Washington, D.C. The series blends crime, mystery, and thriller elements, following Cross as he tackles complex cases while balancing his personal life. Since its inception in 1993, the franchise has expanded into novels, films, and an upcoming television series.",
        "summary": "Isaiah Mustafa, known for his role as the \"Old Spice Guy,\" has significantly advanced his acting career, with a notable role as Detective John Sampson in Prime Video's \"Cross\" Season 1. Mustafa's portrayal of Sampson, a character previously played by Bill Nunn, showcases his ability to move beyond his Old Spice persona, bringing depth and charisma to the role. The show includes a humorous nod to Mustafa's past with a joke about Sampson's use of Old Spice, adding a layer of meta-humor for those familiar with his commercials. Mustafa's career has evolved from guest roles in series like \"Chuck\" and \"Nikita\" to more substantial parts, including a lead role in \"Shadowhunters\" and a significant role in \"IT: Chapter Two.\" \"Cross\" might be a turning point in Mustafa's career, potentially establishing Sampson as his signature role, with the character expected to play a larger part in the upcoming second season.",

Order the midrange headset today and the retailer will hook you up with a free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow, a three-month trial to Meta Quest Plus, AND a $75 Amazon digital credit at no additional cost. All things said and done, the amount of free goodies adds up to $145, which is pretty darn impressive considering that the Quest 3S only retails for $299.99.\n\nThe first Meta Quest 3S deal of Black Friday 2024 has landed, and it's no joke\n\nMeta Quest 3S 128GB: $299.99, plus free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow, three-month trial of Meta Quest Plus, and FREE $75 digital credit at Amazon Android Central review: ★★★★½ Pick up the Meta Quest 3S from Amazon and you'll get a free $75 gift card, plus all of the free goodies that usually come with new Quest purchases, like a three-month trial of Meta Quest Plus and a free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow. The Quest 3S is sure to be one of the hottest items on wish lists this holiday season, so I'd skip the crowds and grab this Black Friday deal today if I were you.\n\n✅Recommended if: you want a great deal on an affordable VR headset; you want to play Meta Quest 3 exclusive titles without dropping a ton of cash; you could use $75 to buy more stuff at Amazon.\n\n❌Skip this deal if: you can afford the Meta Quest 3; you want to wait and see what other Black Friday deals go live next week.\n\nMeta's attempt at producing the perfect affordable VR headset, the Quest 3S is an incredible pick if you want a cutting-edge virtual reality experience without breaking the bank.\n\nComparing the Meta Quest 3S vs the Quest 3, you'll notice that the affordable headset really isn't that different from its pricier big sibling. The two VR headsets share the same Snapdragon processor, mixed reality tech, and graphical power, plus you get access to all of the same exclusive games and apps. Sure, you're taking a hit with display resolution if you choose the Quest 3S, and you'll have to deal with a narrower FoV, but if you were a fan of the Quest 2 or you'd simply rather not drop $500 on yet another video game console, the Meta Quest 3S is a great deal — especially when you pair it with over $140 of free stuff from Amazon.\n\nCan we expect to see more Meta Quest deals as we approach Black Friday 2024? Probably, but if you want to get your holiday shopping done early, it doesn't get much better than this.",

        "content": "A new wave of AI-generated influencers is taking over Instagram, built on content stolen from real porn stars and models without their consent. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta does not appear to be taking action against the scam dubbed “AI pimping.”\n\nWired reports that a growing industry of “AI pimping” is flooding social media with deepfake influencers, taking over platforms like Instagram with artificially generated profiles. These AI influencers are often trained on stolen photos and videos from real porn stars and Instagram models. Realistic AI-generated faces are then swapped onto the bodies of humans to create fake but convincing new content.\n\nThe practice has exploded in scale in recent months, making it clear that Mark Zuckerbeg’s Instagram is either unable or unwilling to stop the deluge of AI-generated profiles. Over 1,000 such accounts were reviewed in an investigation, with 10 percent featuring deepfake videos that stole the appearance of real women. Some of these accounts self-identify as AI-generated “virtual models,” while others provide no disclosure.\n\nPorn stars say they are now directly competing with, and losing income to, the AI impersonators. Adult actress Elaina St James said her Instagram reach and views have plummeted as the number of AI accounts has surged. “It’s because I’m competing with something that’s unnatural,” she said.\n\nCreating these fake profiles is easier than ever thanks to a plethora of easily accessible AI tools and “how-to” guides being sold online. For $200 or less, anyone can buy detailed video courses on “AI pimping.” The guides recommend using various apps to generate realistic faces, bodies, and personas. Some of the apps have been available on Apple and Google’s app stores. There are even “one-stop-shop” websites that streamline the whole process of spinning up AI influencers.\n\nThe people behind the accounts, mostly men, then use them to funnel followers to pay-per-view porn sites, subscription services, and “dating” chat services. Step-by-step strategies are taught for luring lonely men to spend more and more money communicating with the AI models.\n\nSome of the “AI pimps” openly brag about how lucrative the illicit cottage industry can be. “Professor EP,” the creator of one popular how-to guide, claims to have made over $1 million in less than 6 months from his AI influencer “Emily Pellegrini.” EP brazenly promotes deepfake technology in his course while maintaining a thin veneer of plausible deniability.\n\nInstagram’s drive for engagement and ad revenue seems to disincentivize a real crackdown, according to researchers. “Instagram can sell this as traffic,” said Alexios Mantzarlis of Cornell Tech. “It can sell ads against this. So, is there a future where actual, real human accounts are almost like an elite, smaller percentage of Instagram? I think yes.”\n\nSt James concurs: “If all of a sudden they got rid of all the bots, the dead accounts, the fake accounts, the imposter accounts, what happens to their advertising?”\n\nRead more at Wired here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.",
        "summary": "A new trend of AI-generated influencers is emerging on Instagram, using content stolen from real porn stars and models without their consent, a practice known as \"AI pimping.\" These AI influencers are created by swapping realistic AI-generated faces onto human bodies, often using stolen images and videos, and have proliferated rapidly on social media platforms like Instagram. Despite the scale of this issue, Instagram, owned by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, has not effectively addressed the problem, with over 1,000 such accounts identified, some featuring deepfake videos. The rise of AI influencers is negatively impacting real adult performers, who report losing income and reach due to competition with these artificial profiles. The creation of these fake profiles is facilitated by accessible AI tools and guides, with individuals using them to direct followers to monetized services, while Instagram's focus on engagement and ad revenue may discourage a crackdown on these accounts.",

This is a brand-new headset that hit the scene in September with a $300 price tag and is yet to have seen a price drop. Today’s deal at Target, though not a straight-up cash discount, lets you save $75 on the headset with a FREE gift card that can go towards securing other deals that are now live at the retailer for Black Friday. Cashing in on this deal and securing the gift card essentially translates to scoring the headset for $225 with a free $50 game, which is great considering this is a brand-new headset that is less than two months old. Head below for more details of the headset.\n\nThe new Meta Quest 3S shares a lot of similarities with the Quest 3 model. It’s powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and also uses the same Touch Plus controllers that’ve come to know and love from its pricier sibling. This new model does have a bigger battery compared to the older one, meaning it’ll last you longer between the charges. The Quest 3S is slightly larger than the previous one, and it has the same 1832 x 1920 per-eye resolution displays to deliver crisp visuals. The headset also comes bundled with the latest Batman: Arkham Shadow along with a 3-month trial of Quest+ to get a taste of Meta’s VR subscription.\n\nIf you’re looking for more deals on VR headsets, then Sony’s PlayStation VR2 is down at $349 right now. It even comes with the Horizon Call of The Mountain game as a bundle and is down from its usual price of $600. PlayStation’s Black Friday 2024 deals are also live right now with deals on PS5 bundles, games, DualSense controllers, and more, so be sure to check it out if you’re looking to save on a new console or some games ahead of the holiday season.\n\nMeta Quest 3S VR headset features:\n\nTransform your reality and do everything you love in totally new ways. Welcome to Meta Quest 3S. Now you can get the Batman: Arkham Shadow* and a 3-month trial of Meta Quest+** (a combined $70 value) with purchase.

        "publish_date": "2024-11-23T12:05:00Z",
        "content": "The Target Black Friday Sale has kicked off in earnest with some major sneak peek discounts we've all been waiting for on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 consoles, peripherals, and video games. But that's not all. Pretty much everything in Target's publicized ad scan has gone live, including Meta Quest VR headsets, LEGOs, board games, toys and more. Many of these deals are priced lower than every other retailer. They all expire on Friday, November 29.\n\nTarget is one of my favorite one-stop shopping sites, both in-store and online. Its prices are very competitive, its return policy is generous, and it has plenty of retail locations so that buying online and picking up in-store is a convenient option. Target offers great exclusive discounts via its Target Circle membership, and best of all, joining is free. There is a paid upgrade that's worth it for regular Target shoppers, and it's on sale for Black Friday as well.\n\nBlack Friday Nintendo Switch Deals\n\nThe Nintendo Switch holiday bundles were already a pretty good deal. For the cost of the Switch console, you were also getting Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. For Black Friday, that's not good enough. So, starting now, Target is taking an extra $75 off both bundles: The Switch OLED bundle is marked down to $275 and the Switch bundle is down to $225. It's refreshing to finally see a better Switch deal after years of the same thing.\n\nUpdate: Target is currently the only place to buy these bundles at this price online without a membership.\n\nMore Nintendo Switch Games Under $40\n\nIn addition to Tears of the Kingdom, plenty of other Nintendo Switch games have broken past the traditional $39.99 \"sale price\" barrier, including the 10/10 \"Masterpiece\" Super Mario Odyssey, the cat-tastic Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, the idyllic Animal Crossing: New Horizons and my kids' favorite, Kirby and the Forgotten Land. Up to now we haven't seen many deals on Switch games at all for Black Friday, so we're glad to see the floodgates opening.\n\nApple AirPods Pro for $153.99\n\nBuy a Meta Quest 3S VR Headset, Get $75 Gift Card\n\nMeta Quest 3S VR Headset with Bonus $75 Card 7 $299.99 at Target $299.99 at Amazon If you thought the Meta Quest 3S was attractively priced at $299.99, well, this deal will blow your socks off. Target is now throwing in a bonus $75 gift card. The Quest 3S adopts many of the same features of the Quest 3, like the new Touch controllers, the upgraded SnapDragon APU, and full color AR passthrough. In his 9/10 Quest 3S review, Gabriel Moss wrote that \"raw processing power, full-color passthrough, and snappy Touch Plus controllers make the Quest 3S a fantastic standalone VR headset that also brings entry-level mixed-reality gaming to the masses for – arguably – the very first time.\"\n\nUp to $150 Off the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Smart Glasses\n\nRay-Ban Meta Wayfarer Smart Glasses with Bonus $90 Gift Card 13 $299.00 save 20% $239.20 at Target $299.00 save 20% $239.20 at Amazon The Meta Wayfarer glasses are certainly an intriguing device, but many of you might not be lured in by the $300 price tag. What if I told you that you could get it for $60 less and Target will even toss in a bonus $90 Target gift card? If you're a regular Target shopper like myself, that's essentially as good as cash. These Wayfarer glasses are an influencer's dream; they have a built-in camera and speakers so you can take videos and photos without every reaching for your phone.\n\n30% Off Apple iPad Air\n\nTarget Circle Deal (Free to Join) iPad Air 5th Gen (M1) 10.9\" 64GB 3 $599.99 save 40% $359.99 at Target Target has the 5th generation iPad Air 10.9\" M1 tablet for only $359.99 after you clip a Target Circle coupon. That makes it $240 cheaper than the current gen 2024 model and one of the best Black Friday iPad deals I've seen. This is still a very relevant tablet in 2024; the Apple M1 chip is more powerful than the A14 Bionic chip in the newest iPad and the A17 Pro in the newest iPad Mini. It features a 10.9\" 2360x1640 Retina display with True Tone and P3 wide color and a USB-C connector.\n\n40% Off Apple Watch Ultra\n\nBest Deal of 2024 Apple Watch Ultra GPS + Cellular Titanium Case 1 $799.99 save 40% $479.99 at Target Here's an amazing Target exclusive Black Friday deal on Apple's flagship watch. The first generation Apple Watch Ultra Smart Watch is down to $479 after a massive $320 (40%) off Target Circle coupon. The Target Circle membership is free to join, so everyone can partake in this deal. That's the best price we've seen for Apple's highest end and most rugged watch in its lineup. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen this watch drop below $600 brand new. The Watch Ultra is definitely the best watch in the lineup for anyone who enjoys the rugged outdoors, thanks to its durability, features, and apps.\n\nBlack Friday PlayStation Deals\n\nSony's Black Friday PlayStation deals all went live on Friday, November 21. Target is one of Sony's major authorized resellers and the massive price drops I've seen on PS5 Slim console bundles, DualSense controllers, PS VR2 headset, and video games are all available on their site.\n\nStar Wars Outlaws for $39.99\n\nMore PS5 and Xbox Video Game Deals\n\nTarget just unloaded a bunch of games for sale. The best deals are on the exceedingly adorable Astro Bot for $49.99, or the gorgeous Stellar Blade for $49.99. If you're a sports gamer, pick up the latest NBA 2K25 game for only $29.99.\n\nTarget isn't the only retailer with games already on sale. For more deals on video games sorted by individual platform, check out our best Black Friday deal guides for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X.\n\nMEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set\n\n$320 Off Apple Watch Ultra\n\nBest Deal of 2024 Apple Watch Ultra GPS + Cellular Titanium Case 1 $799.99 save 40% $479.99 at Target Target is offering a brand new Apple Watch Ultra (1st gen) for only $479.99 after you clip the $320 off Target Circle coupon. This is Apple's best watch, with a titanium case that's more rugged and corrosion resistant than the softer aluminum casing found in most Apple Watches. Pure titanium (not titanium \"coated\") metal is considerably more expensive and is one of the main reasons why the Apple Watch Ultra commands a high price tag. The size of the case is also larger at 49mm (compared to 41mm-45mm for the Series 8). Other upgrades over the Series 8 include a brighter display protected by a scratch resistant sapphire crystal face, a precise dual-frequency GPS, beam-forming triple microphone array, dual speakers, up to 36 hours of battery life, up to 100m (300ft) of water resistance, a customizable physical action button next to the crown, and a built-in Oceanic+ app that literally puts a dive computer on your wrist.\n\nBlack Friday Apple Deals\n\nTarget is an excellent site to source your Apple Black Friday deals. They've marked down the entire assortment of Apple devices, including iPads, Apple Watches, AirPods, and more. Many of them are at the lowest prices of the year, although at this point it won't hurt to wait just a few days long and see if Target decides to move the needle just a little bit more.\n\n75\" Westinghouse 4K Roku TV for $399.99\n\n75\" Westinghouse 4K Roku TV 7 $499.99 save 20% $399.99 at Target This is easily the best TV deal in Target's ad scan, which is why it's on their front page. Target will drop the price on this Westinghouse TV from $499.99 to $399.99, making it one of the least expensive 75\" TVs we'll see for Black Friday. Aside from the absolutely gigantic screen size, a native 4K resolution, and 60Hz refresh rate, this TV also features the Roku smart interface. I personally prefer Roku over Fire TV or Google TV because it's more intuitive to use.\n\n65\" Hisense 4K Smart TV for $254.99\n\nUp to 50% Off Board Games\n\nTarget's online storefront has a great assortment of board games, definitely much broader than the selection you'll find in its retail stores. Some of these board games are on sale right now with discounts of up to 50% off, and I expect more board games deals to be added to the list. Board games are always a great gift for anyone who enjoys gaming with friends.\n\nAsus ROG Ally for $349.99\n\nAsus ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 512GB Gaming Handheld 6 $499.99 save 30% $349.99 at Target $499.99 save 30% $349.99 at Best Buy Target has dropped the price of the Asus ROG Ally Z1 gaming handheld PC to only $349.99 after a $150 discount. This is currently the least expensive cost of entry to the world of gaming handheld PCs. The ROG Ally runs off Windows 11. The benefit compared to the Steam Deck, which runs off SteamOS, is that the ROG Ally is compatible with pretty much any Windows-based game client, including Steam, Battle.net, Xbox Games Pass, Epic Games Store, GOG, Ubisoft Connect, and more. That makes it more attractive to gamers who like to play games that aren't available on Steam.\n\nFree Pair of Slippers\n\nTarget Circle 360 exclusive\n\nTarget Circle 360 Exclusive Free Pair of Target Adult Bullseye Slippers 2 $15.00 Free at Target Who doesn't love a good ol' freebie for Black Friday? Target is offering a free pair of fuzzy wuzzy Target Adult Bullseye Slippers for Target Circle 360 members. These slippers normally cost $15, so if you sign up for the membership at the promotional price of $50, you're already a third of the way towards getting your money's worth!\n\nFree Air Wick Scented Oil Air Freshener\n\nFree Air Wick Scented Oil Air Freshener 0 Clip the $4 off Target Circle coupon $3.99 Free at Target You don't need to be a Target Circle 360 member to get this freebie. Target is offering a single pack of the Air Wick Scented Oil Air Freshener, with warmer included, for free after you clip the $4 off Target Circle coupon. Supposedly it lasts for 60 days, and you can easily top it off with Air Wick refills. I much prefer this over scented candles because it doesn't leave soot residue everywhere.\n\nUp to 40% Off LEGO Sets\n\nLEGOs are one of the best gift ideas for the holidays, so LEGO deals get snapped up pretty quickly during Black Friday. Target is advertising select sets for up to 40% off. We've added all of the ones that are shown in the ad scan that have been discounted, but expect to see even more sets on sale in the coming days.\n\nBuy 2, Get 1 Free on Books, Movies, and Music\n\nStarting now, Target Circle members will be able to buy two books, movies, or music and get a third free. Some examples include the kids' favorites Percy Jackson or Dog Man book series, the recently released Inside Out 2 on Blu-ray or 4K Ultra HD, or vinyl from superstars like Sabrina Carpenter or Taylor Swift. I'm personally hoping to fill out my Lord of the Rings library collection for this round of Black Friday.\n\nThanksgiving Meal for Under $20\n\nThanksgiving Meal for Under $20 1 $20.00 at Target Who says Thanksgiving get-togethers have to be expensive for the host? Target is offering enough food to provide for a Thanksgiving meal for four for under $20. The list includes a 10lb turkey, potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing, gravy, cream of mushroom soup, and green beans. This deal is already live.\n\n50% Off Target Circle 360 Membership",

        "content": "Most social media platforms, from X to Facebook, are designed to make it difficult to put down your phone. Companies achieve this goal via algorithms, which in short are mathematical formulas that populate your feed with content relevant to your interests. As a result, you stay engaged and keep scrolling.\n\nAlthough algorithms are meant to show you posts you like, sometimes the model gets things wrong or your tastes change. In such cases, you’ll want to adjust the app to reflect your preferences again. Instagram is making this process easy for users by allowing them to reset the algorithm so it can relearn their interests and recommend more appropriate content.\n\nMeta (which owns Instagram) is testing this “Reset Suggested Content” feature, which is not yet available to everyone. As of writing, the app update has no wide release date. Still, we’ll cover the steps so you’ll know what to do when the day comes.\n\nFirst, go to your Instagram profile and press the hamburger menu button at the top right corner of the screen to open your settings. Scroll to “What you see” and press “Content preferences.” Then, select the “Reset suggested content” option. Follow the prompts to finish the process.\n\nInstagram will then treat your account as a new user, but your following list and saved posts won’t be affected. To rebuild your algorithm, remember to be mindful about which posts and accounts you interact with, as that will inform Instagram of your interests.\n\nAccording to The Times of India, there are ways to adjust your algorithm manually without waiting for the new feature to roll out. For example, you can clear your search history by going to “Your activity” instead of “Content preferences” from the settings menu. From there, tap “Recent searches” and “Clear all.” Being intentional about how you interact with your feed—by liking and commenting on posts you want to see more of and quickly scrolling away from those you want to see less of—will also impact what the app shows you.\n\nMeta explained the reasoning behind the change in a statement on November 19, 2024. The company emphasizes its goal to create “safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences” for Instagram users, especially teens. The update also gives dissatisfied users a way to improve their experience before ditching the app altogether.\n\nRead More About the Internet:",

Instagram is testing a new \"Reset Suggested Content\" feature that allows users to reset the algorithm to better reflect their current interests. This feature is not yet widely available, but users can prepare by learning how to access it through their settings. In the meantime, users can manually adjust their algorithm by clearing search history and being intentional about their interactions on the platform.

        "publish_date": "2024-11-22T17:06:48Z",
        "content": "Meta provided insight this week into the company’s efforts in taking down more than 2 million accounts that were connected to pig butchering scams on their owned platforms, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nPig butchering scams are big business, with hundreds of millions of dollars involved every year. The numbers are not precise because some researchers see these scams as a special kind of romance scam, while others classify them as investment fraud, muddying the numbers based on which group is counting what type of loss.\n\nStill, the general idea is that scammers use elaborate storylines to fatten up victims into believing they are in a romantic or otherwise close personal relationship. Once the victim places enough trust in the scammer, they bring the victim into a cryptocurrency investment scheme. Then comes the “butchering”—an attempt to “bleed” a target dry of their money.\n\nPig butchering, however, isn’t always a simple case of cybercriminals preying on unsuspecting victims. As Meta described, sometimes the scammers themselves are victims that work in scam centers, mainly located in Asia.\n\n“These criminal scam hubs lure often unsuspecting job seekers with too-good-to-be-true job postings on local job boards, forums, and recruitment platforms to then force them to work as online scammers, often under the threat of physical abuse.”\n\nThese workers not only work on pig butchering scams. They are also forced to engage in a wide range of malicious activities that can involve cryptocurrency and gambling, or they can be tasked to carry out impersonation scams.\n\nWorking with expert NGOs and law enforcement partners in the US and Southeast Asia, Meta has focused on investigating and disrupting the activities of the criminal scam centers in Southeast Asia. This has led to the take-down of over two million accounts linked to scam centers in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines.\n\nDespite their location, the targets of the scams can be found all over the globe. The scammers follow playbooks to gain the trust of the targets. Contacting victims initially on social media, dating apps, email, or messaging apps, the scammers later move their interactions to more private channels like scammer-controlled accounts on crypto apps or scam websites masquerading as investment platforms. This pushes victims further into a trap and it removes their ability to report their conversations to a platform that takes this type of abuse seriously.\n\nFrom here, scammers will continue the charade that they’ve set up wise investments for the targets. But once enough trust has been built to seriously rob a victim, scammers will steal what they can and disappear. As Meta said:\n\n“Typical of ‘pig butchering’ schemes, the target may be allowed to withdraw small amounts to build trust, but once they start asking for their ‘investment’ back or it becomes clear that they do not have more funds to send to the scammer, overseas scammers typically disappear with all the money.”\n\nHow to avoid becoming the pig\n\nThe good thing about pig butchery scams is that they mostly follow a narrow pattern, with few variations. If you recognize the signs, you stand a very good chance of going about your day with a distinct lack of pig-related issues. The signs are:\n\nReceiving stray messages for “someone else” that appear out of the blue. This can be a message directed to someone who does not have your name.\n\nThe profile picture of the person you’re talking to looks like someone who is a model.\n\nCommon scam opening lines may involve: Sports, golfing, travel, fitness.\n\nAt some point they will ask you about investments and/or cryptocurrency.\n\nThey will ask you to invest or take some of their money and use that instead.\n\nAs you can see, there is a very specific goal in mind for the pig butcher scammers, and if you find yourself drawn down this path, the alarm bells should be ringing by step 4 or 5. This is definitely one of those “If it’s too good to be true” moments, and the part where you make your excuses and leave (but not before hitting block and reporting them).\n\nHere’s what you can do to keep yourself safe:\n\nDon’t give scammers the information they need. Scammers rely on what you volunteer about yourself online to tweak their script and lure you in. Use tools such as the Malwarebytes Personal Data Remover to minimize the amount of data accessible through search engine results, spam lists, and people search sites.\n\nPerform an image search of the photo and the name of the person you’re in touch with. Scammers often steal someone else’s image to use as bait, and stolen identities are rife.\n\nGo slow. Scammers tend to rush, building rapport with their victims as quickly as possible before moving in for the money-themed kill.\n\nNever give money to anyone you’ve met online\n\nGet a second opinion from someone you trust\n\nIf in doubt, back away and report the account.\n\nIf you’ve been impacted by a romance scam, pig butchering, or crypto investment fraud, you can report the crime to the Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3), which is run by the FBI, or the FTC on its reporting and resources page.\n\nWe don’t just report on threats – we help protect your social media\n\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. Protect your social media accounts by using Malwarebytes Identity Theft Protection.",

        "content": "Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta, stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.\n\nThe justices heard arguments in November in Meta’s bid to shut down the lawsuit. On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.\n\nThe high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.\n\nInvestors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nInadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court’s action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.\n\nMeta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.\n\nCambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies.

        "summary": "The Supreme Court has allowed a class action lawsuit against Meta, Facebook's parent company, to proceed, related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The lawsuit claims Meta failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, leading to significant stock price drops in 2018. Meta has already paid substantial fines and settlements over the issue but plans to continue defending itself in court. Cambridge Analytica, linked to Trump strategist Steve Bannon, accessed data from millions of Facebook users to influence the 2016 U.S. election. This case is one of two involving tech companies at the Supreme Court, with another lawsuit against Nvidia concerning alleged misleading information about its cryptocurrency-related sales.",

On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.\n\nThe high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.\n\nInvestors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nInadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court’s action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.\n\nMeta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.\n\nWhat to know about Trump’s second term:\n\nStaffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.\n\nCambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies.

        "content": "The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta, stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.\n\nThe justices heard arguments in November in Meta's bid to shut down the lawsuit. On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.\n\nThe high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.\n\nInvestors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nInadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court's action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.\n\nMeta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.\n\nCambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against Nvidia. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency.",
        "summary": "The Supreme Court has allowed a class action lawsuit against Meta, Facebook's parent company, to proceed, related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The lawsuit claims Meta failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, leading to significant stock price drops in 2018. The Supreme Court dismissed Meta's appeal, upholding a lower court's decision to allow the case to continue. Meta has already paid significant fines and settlements related to the scandal, but maintains that the lawsuit's claims are baseless. This case is one of two involving tech companies facing class-action lawsuits, with the other involving Nvidia and its alleged misleading of investors about its cryptocurrency-related sales.",

Threads is also testing a new trending page in the US that includes additional topics to follow as well as AI-generated summaries of what other users are talking about.\n\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri, who led the launch of Threads, wrote in a post that the tests begin today.\n\nThis week has been full of updates on Threads, which is facing increased competition from Bluesky, the decentralized text-based platform that people have been flocking to in recent weeks. Earlier this week, Threads rolled out a custom feeds option that allows users to pin multiple curated feeds on the homepage. Users can create custom feeds for certain topics or accounts, giving them more flexibility beyond the algorithmic recommendations feed or the reverse chronological following feed. The feature has existed for a while on Bluesky, and Meta announced and rolled out its own copycat version in just a few days.\n\nA long-running complaint about Threads is that the default home feed is filled with irrelevant, at times annoying content from accounts users don’t follow (Bluesky’s default feed is the opposite). Just yesterday, Mosseri said Meta was tweaking the Threads algorithm to prioritize posts from people you do follow, a significant change to how the platform ranks content. There are still questions about whether this change would actually make Threads feel more timely — though it might be many times larger than Bluesky, logging on and seeing posts from two days ago makes Threads feel dead.",

        "content": "In recent years, the concept of the metaverse has gained increasing resonance in both research and public discourse, perhaps second only to artificial intelligence. Discussion persists, however, around the nature of the metaverse. Several studies have attempted to offer a definition, also considering how use of the term has changed over the past 20 years. For example, Markus Weinberger used qualitative meta-synthesis methods to analyze existing literature, proposing the following definition: The Metaverse is an interconnected web of ubiquitous virtual worlds partly overlapping with and enhancing the physical world. These virtual worlds enable users who are represented by avatars to connect and interact with each other, and to experience and consume user-generated content in an immersive, scalable, synchronous, and persistent environment. An economic system provides incentives for contributing to the Metaverse.30 As seen here, ideas of community and connection between users seem to be important in defining the metaverse, as do notions of “hyper-spatio-temporality” and “multitechnology convergence.”29 These goals can be achieved through various technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, avatar-based and second life systems, learning management systems, social media, simulation, and AI.17 Key Insights The success of the metaverse relies on providing a compelling user experience that addresses both technical aspects and users’ cultural needs.\n\nThe metaverse presents significant ethical challenges, such as privacy risks and potential harm from blurred lines between the virtual and real worlds, necessitating regulation and risk assessment.\n\nThe metaverse has found significant success in South Korea, where it caters to both a highly competitive culture and a desire for new forms of self-expression beyond traditional societal constraints.\n\nOvercoming ethical risks and aligning with cultural backgrounds are essential for building trust and motivating users to engage in the metaverse. The recent Gartner report “Emerging Tech: Adopter Anti-patterns—Metaverse Use Cases Are Plagued by Low Adoption” discusses some of the limitations that hinder mass adoption of the metaverse. The report points out two major issues. The first is the application of virtual reality (VR) in non-gaming environments, which often fails to meet the expectations and scope anticipated by users. We must mention, though, that VR has been successfully adopted in specific applications and tasks where entertainment is not the main scope, such as in industry, healthcare, and education, and that the metaverse is not the same as VR. The second issue concerns virtual meetings with avatars in the metaverse, which have not yet achieved a level of engagement necessary for enduring and meaningful experiences. From the report, it appears that the metaverse died an early death. However, is this really the case? What is it that could attract people once the technical and ethical problems are solved? And why do some countries seem to be especially fascinated by it? In this article, we will investigate how the metaverse is changing the concept of user experience, identify the technical and ethical shortcomings it still faces, and, finally, explore the cultural factors favoring its adoption in South Korea.\n\nMotivation, User Experience, and Interoperability During the 2023 Augmented World Expo (AWE) USA conference, Neal Stephenson—the writer who coined the term metaverse in his 1992 novel Snow Crash—asserted that entrepreneurs, innovators, and companies investing time and money in the metaverse should seriously consider why people would want to use it, since people are only drawn to new innovations if they are either fun or essential. An important element to consider, then, is user motivation. According to Keith Kirkpatrick, attracting and retaining metaverse users will require “a robust communications infrastructure, powerful and easy-to-use development platforms and, perhaps most importantly, compelling applications that provide value to users that cannot be replicated or found elsewhere.”11 We believe that two more aspects should be taken into consideration: providing a quality user experience from both technical and ethical perspectives, and satisfying the needs arising from people’s historical, social, and cultural backgrounds. The first point to address when considering use of the metaverse is how it changes the user experience. At the very beginning of the computer era, there was basically no interaction between the user and the machine because everything was operator-mediated through punch cards. Only after the introduction of the personal computer did the importance of letting people interact with machines become clear, giving rise to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), together with the introduction of graphical windows, icons, menus, pointers (WIMP) interfaces; direct manipulation; and metaphors.22 The idea was to make interactive systems more usable by moving from “people adapting to technology” to “technology adapting to people,” while still requiring users to learn the machine’s language. For many years, the only improvements were to the fundamental ideas implemented in WIMP interfaces. The next big advance was the smartphone, implementing a different interaction paradigm and becoming not just an instrument but also a seamless part of the user’s world. Still, the user had to make an effort in learning to execute tasks—essentially learning a new language—while, again, the goal of usability is to move the workload from the user to the system.18 Meanwhile, game design followed a completely separate path (probably guided by its different purpose: entertainment), developing engaging, immersive interaction environments in which players pursue a game’s goals and have fun. We are now in a historic moment in which two scientific advances are radically changing the concept of person-machine interactions and blurring the line between the real and the digital. The first is represented by large language models (LLMs), resulting in systems that, for the first time, really speak the user’s language without the need for translation. The second is the metaverse, in which interaction takes place in ways similar to those of the human world but offers infinite possibilities. In both cases, the interaction is focused on building a truly personalized user experience. We can see, though, that the metaverse brings with it a shift in the concept of human-computer interaction. The promise of a fully immersive digital universe led to the establishment of a research area for the blending of the physical and the virtual. The challenge is to create “a real-virtual bridge, a conceptual model that can be used to mediate between real and virtual objects.”27 Researchers aim to make the interaction mechanics more intuitive, addressing, for example, the relationship between gestures and devices in the metaverse, such as smartphone operation3,26 and text-entry methods,5 as well as the relationship between the metaverse and the Internet of Things (IoT).15,23 Nonetheless, for many users, the learning curve is still steeper than desired, the user experience is not yet engaging enough, and the graphics and rendering capabilities, while advanced, still lack the refinement and realism that many expect.8 The metaverse brings with it a shift in the concept of human-computer interaction. Another significant limitation is interoperability, which in the context of the metaverse has been defined as “enabling people to move to new networks with their avatars and virtual property.”16 Lack of interoperability affects the user experience because, without mobility, users may find themselves confined to specific ecosystems, potentially leading to fragmented communities, echo chambers, and a stifling of innovation.8 It’s akin to isolated islands in an ocean, where each island operates on its own rules and systems. To truly realize the potential of the metaverse, bridges must be built between these islands, promoting collaboration, shared experiences, and a more interconnected digital realm. To solve this problem, it has been proposed to build an open and interoperable metaverse using the Web and its standards.7,19 As we can see, many efforts are being made to overcome the technical limitations that still hinder adoption of the metaverse. The next few years will likely see advances in virtual reality hardware, augmented reality integration, and the overall blending of our physical and digital worlds.12 Until then, the metaverse remains a work in progress, with its full potential yet to be realized.\n\nAn Ethics for the Metaverse The introduction and use of the metaverse raises relevant ethical issues, which, like deficiencies in the user experience, contribute to driving users away because of perceived danger. Like LLMs, the metaverse is a tool that could reach a wider audience, and for this reason there is a need for risk assessment, regulation, and user awareness.20 For example, in a 2008 paper Edward Spence discusses the rights and obligations of avatars.25 Influenced by Alan Gewirth’s principle of generic consistency (PGC), Spence formulates an ethical framework for digital domains. The PGC suggests that, when acting within virtual environments, any individual inherently deserves the rights to freedom and well-being. Rooted in the notion that people use avatars in the metaverse to represent themselves, Spence’s theory posits that avatars act as digital reflections of real-world individuals. Given this, they should not only be granted the same rights but should also adhere to real-world ethical standards. Though it might seem to be a mostly theoretical issue, misconduct of avatars is a real problem, as in the case of sexual harassment. In the U.S., more than 40 percent of Internet users have encountered online harassment, a problem that becomes particularly salient in the metaverse, where harassment can feel even more personal and intimidating due to the lifelike nature of virtual environments.21 Philosophical models can help us define the metaverse, as well as the relationship between avatars and real people. Building trust in the metaverse, however, requires a bottom-up approach that addresses the problems that arise from actual use. So how can we build an effective, reality-based model of the metaverse that merges theoretical background with real problems? Some studies propose starting with AI ethics, which has developed significantly in recent years as a response to the widespread adoption of AI technologies.1 AI ethics emerged because AI is a technological innovation that has a profound impact on society, like the metaverse might have in the future. As the metaverse incorporates AI components, it could face similar risks,28 but it also introduces unique challenges deriving mostly from the problematic relationship between the real and the virtual. As such, an ethics of the metaverse should begin by addressing the illusions created by virtual environments, which necessitate contributions from cognitive science.4 Experiencing virtual worlds can lead to illusions about oneself and one’s relationships, with potentially dangerous effects on one’s actions in the real world, perceptions of reality, and self-representation. The metaverse could in fact pose risks to mental and social health if people become addicted to it and use it as an escape from reality, leading to confusion between the real and virtual worlds, post-VR sadness and hangovers, dissociation, diminished sensitivity to the consequences of actions in the real world, cybersickness, and, in extreme cases, severe mental disorders.1 For these reasons, it is crucial for potential users to be psychologically prepared to avoid addiction and maintain the distinction between the real and the virtual. In this regard, protecting children is an important area of concern, with potential risks such as the formation of false memories, desensitization to tangible threats, moral disengagement, technological addiction, and cyberbullying.10 It is crucial for potential users to be psychologically prepared to avoid addiction and maintain the distinction between the real and the virtual. Confusion between the virtual and the real can also be caused by excessive sharing of personal and biometric data with avatars.13 In a recent paper, Carl Smith and colleagues 24 emphasized that privacy encompasses not only personal information but also our body image and data. The concern is that once a person’s body image is captured, it can be perpetually used in deep-fake productions. There is therefore a need to expand legal protections of individual rights to include control over biological data, which includes various forms of biometric data. Protection of mental privacy is equally essential, since interactions in the metaverse might use brainwave capture to enhance experiences, for example, through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Some of these emerging technologies have the potential to essentially interpret human thoughts, model identities, draw detailed and contextually relevant conclusions, and then infer thought processes via machine learning.2 The problematic relationship between the virtual and real worlds can cause both technical and ethical issues. Each of the issues mentioned—and potentially many more—merits a more detailed discussion, which in some cases has already been started by researchers. The complexity of these issues highlights the imperative of expanded ethical deliberation on metaverse usage and the pressing need to regulate user behavior. Questions about how to penalize misconduct and determine the appropriate regulations and policies for the metaverse must be addressed.20 Moreover, there is an urgent need to enhance monitoring tools: In the metaverse, interactions will be more immediate and direct compared with traditional social media platforms, necessitating effective real-time moderation and oversight mechanisms.21 These tools must adeptly blend real and virtual content, striking a balance between ensuring user freedom and filtering malicious or inappropriate content. An interesting emerging idea is that addressing ethical issues and ensuring control and security would actually make the metaverse more trustworthy, fostering its adoption. That said, it is also necessary to provide a technology capable of matching social and cultural expectations, discussed in the next section.\n\nMatching Cultural Expectations: The Case of South Korea Each culture is different. This is why it is not easy to design a technology that is equally effective everywhere and for everyone, as highlighted by the postcolonial computing approach.9 Due to its immersive experience, the metaverse faces this problem even more so than other technologies. Indeed, we believe the metaverse is a concept whose acceptance and success are deeply rooted in the cultural backgrounds and expectations of people. This idea is based on observing how the metaverse has achieved significant success among the public, industries, and policymakers of countries like South Korea and Japan. As an example, we will discuss the South Korean case. The metaverse is a visible and growing phenomenon in South Korea, going beyond just being a source of entertainment. The Ministry of Science has introduced an ambitious plan, rooted in the Digital New Deal 2.0, to position South Korea as a dominant player in the global metaverse landscape. The plan’s key components include developing a platform ecosystem centered around Korean cultural content, nurturing talent, supporting enterprises, and creating an ethical, inclusive metaverse. The South Korean government’s investment in this technology is fueled by the population’s enthusiasm for it and the potential applications it offers. A global survey conducted in 2022 by Ipsos, on behalf of the World Economic Forum, revealed a 71% familiarity rate with the metaverse in South Korea, higher than the average of the nations analyzed. Moreover, 63% of South Koreans expressed a positive outlook on integrating extended reality into their daily lives, compared with the global average of 50%. Another Ipsos survey, published in September 2022 and titled “Gen Z and the Metaverse,” sheds light on South Korea’s Gen Z perspective, which sees the virtual world as a platform brimming with opportunities for both entertainment and financial gain. Gen Z fosters close connections with friends made in the virtual world and adeptly seeks out like-minded individuals within the metaverse. To them, the metaverse is viewed as a more effective and flexible environment than the real world, enabling users to readily pursue their aspirations and explore new horizons. In recent years, social changes in South Korea have weakened certain cultural heritage principles, such as the emphasis on the group over the individual, while strengthening the desire for self-affirmation and fulfilling personal needs. A growing number of people have begun using service platforms that not only cater to the hectic pace of contemporary life but also provide the opportunity to limit social interaction, which is increasingly seen as entrenched in formalities and part of a hierarchical system that younger generations are rejecting. For this reason, the government has viewed the “untact policy” as a potential means to stimulate economic development. Untact is a term created in South Korea by adding the privative prefix un to the word contact. It refers to a “service provided without face-to-face encounters between employees and customers using digital technologies.14 Launched in 2020, the idea of untact gained momentum during the pandemic and quickly extended into various sectors. Though concerns about isolation and societal fragmentation persist, for a multitude of individuals, the policy has brought several benefits, such as enabling anonymity, alleviating the burden of formality, and mitigating the emotional labor often associated with the service industry. South Korea’s transition toward a social culture of metaverse technology, as well as its positive reception, is indeed a rather expected development. This technology is already widely applied in the entertainment industry, for example, in the realm of K-pop, where fans design avatars that allow them to encounter their beloved artists virtually. It is relevant to mention the case of Mave, a South Korean girl quartet, which gained 20 million views on YouTube and exists solely in the virtual world: The four members reside within the metaverse, and their songs, choreography, interviews, and even their hairstyles are all crafted by Web designers and AI. In South Korea, the metaverse offers individuals an opportunity to seek refuge in a reality where they can express their own identity, transcending the norms of a society deeply rooted in Confucianism. To understand why the untact policy and the metaverse are so successful in South Korea today, we must explore its cultural background. In South Korea, the metaverse offers individuals an opportunity to seek refuge in a reality where they can express their own identity, transcending the norms of a society deeply rooted in Confucianism, which rose to prominence on the Korean peninsula during the 15th century. Despite South Korea’s modernization and the widespread adoption of Christianity, the enduring influence of this traditional philosophy is still evident in family relationships, political attitudes, and approaches to problem solving. Morality, practicality, and self-cultivation are the pillars of Confucianism.6 It posits that excellence must be pursued in both inner morality and outer achievements. In politics and education, the Confucian concept of leader and subject continues to be advocated, with the public encouraged to uphold the traditional notion of the leader as a combination of king, teacher, and father.33 Simultaneously, there is an expectation for leaders to exhibit high moral standards, considered essential for fostering a strong sense of community. Thus, Confucianism highlights the importance of maintaining a harmonious and ongoing connection between the individual and the universe, between the pursuit of knowledge and personal growth, and between the principles governing family structure and the sociopolitical framework. Each person plays various roles in society, from their private responsibilities within their families to their public roles in areas such as politics and the economy. These principles have molded a society that is highly organized and collectivist, marked by significant social expectations in terms of behavior and adherence to cultural norms. Another factor that influenced the shaping of today’s society is Korea’s history of struggle in establishing itself as an independent, recognized nation. Initially, this involved breaking free from Chinese political and cultural dominance and then from Japanese colonization and Western influences. All of this has laid the groundwork for a significant sense of national belonging and a strong sense of identity. Koreans experienced three distressing historical events in the 20th century—the Japanese occupation, the Korean war, and the division of the country—that made nationalism a prominent factor in nation-building. During the 1950s, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world, remaining so for more than a decade. The Japanese occupation and the Korean War caused enormous economic losses and huge casualties, but the Korean people focused on their nation’s reconstruction and today South Korea is one of the richest, most influential countries in the world. The aftermath of these significant challenges and the need for social redemption, coupled with the desire to break free from the past, has driven the country toward policies aimed at creating a highly competitive society. Individuals of all ages, genders, and social backgrounds orient their lives around enhancing their competitive edge. This inclination is particularly evident in the domains of education and employment, with the younger generation devoting extra hours to private academies in pursuit of admission to prestigious universities and securing positions in leading companies. The Korean commitment to self-improvement has indeed spurred rapid progress, but it has also led to heightened exhaustion. In a society characterized by cutthroat competition, a larger number of people encounter setbacks than achieve success. For those grappling with challenges, finding pride in their country’s accomplishments can prove to be difficult. Moreover, when people feel that, despite their best efforts, they cannot overcome the limitations imposed by their socioeconomic backgrounds, it can engender a sense of relative deprivation. The fact that the happiness level of South Koreans ranks among the lowest in the world may be intertwined with this demanding social environment. However, as the free market emerged and technology advanced, the limitations on individuals gradually waned, leading to the erosion of village traditions and extended family systems. For many people—especially the young—this transformation has created the need for new forms of socialization. In South Korea, therefore, the metaverse has proven to be a successful technology because it addresses two opposing social forces: on one hand, the high level of competitiveness that makes innovation more acceptable than in Western countries; and on the other hand, the people’s search for new spaces for self-expression, where they can freely build communities beyond social limitations.",

        "content": "The US Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by Meta Platforms Inc., leaving it to face a lawsuit that accuses the company of misleading shareholders about the data-harvesting scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\nInvestors claim the company, then known as Facebook, inflated share prices by failing to adequately disclose the risk that its user data would be misused. The shareholders say revelations about the scandal contributed to two 2018 price drops that cost the company more than $200 billion in market value.\n\nMeta was asking the Supreme Court to reverse a federal appeals court decision that had let the lawsuit go forward. The court heard arguments on Nov. 6.\n\nAs is its usual practice, the high court didn’t provide any explanation for dropping the case, saying only that it was being “dismissed as improvidently granted.”\n\nBusiness groups led by the Chamber of Commerce had urged the court to take up the case and side with Meta, saying that risk-disclosure allegations have contributed to a wave of meritless securities-fraud suits.\n\nThe Supreme Court is also considering an appeal by Nvidia Corp., which is being sued for allegedly misleading shareholders about its reliance on crypto-mining revenue in the run-up to a market crash.\n\nThe case is Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, 23-980.\n\nPhoto: Photographer: Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg\n\nCopyright 2024 Bloomberg.\n\nTopics Lawsuits",

        "content": "21 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nIt makes sense that Charles Yu’s acclaimed 2020 novel “Interior Chinatown” would eventually be adapted into a TV series. After all, its title is taken from a screenplay’s slugline, and the entire novel is written in a screenplay format. Further, Yu’s writing on “Westworld,” “Lodge 49,” and “Legion” suggests a writer interested in heady concepts and maximalist execution. It seems like a straightforward jump from script to screen, right?\n\n‘Interior Chinatown’: Taika Waititi & Showrunner Charles Yu Discuss Their Surreal Comedy Series, Background Characters, ‘Star Wars’ & More [Bingeworthy Podcast]\n\nYet, while the show is amusing and insightful in fits and starts as it dismantles the cliches surrounding minority representation in police procedurals, it’s also a confounding mix of contrasting tones and styles. That seems purposeful, as Yu and first-episode director/executive producer Taika Waititi dial up the juxtaposition between the grounded reality of Willis Wu’s (Jimmy O. Yang) existence as a waiter in a Chinatown restaurant and the over-the-top conspiracy that he lands himself in.\n\nA background actor in his own story, Wu’s existence is a constant cycle of work at his Uncle’s Chinese restaurant, with his equally marginalized friend Fatty (Ronny Chieng) and his home life with his parents (Tzi Ma and Diana Lin). As the show begins, Willis sees a kidnapping that leads him into the world of ‘Black and White,’ a crime procedural led by Turner (Sullivan Jones) and Green (Lisa Gilroy), two hardened cops straight out of a “Law and Order” spoof.\n\nWhile investigating the crime, the two detectives are forced to take on Lana Lee (Chloe Bennet), a newer detective assigned to the case as the ‘Chinatown expert’ based on her race. Lee and Wu eventually team up, hoping to break out of their assigned cultural roles and become the protagonists in their own stories. All the while, they try to solve the case of Wu’s missing brother (Chris Pang), a Kung Fu master who went missing years before.\n\nSupport independent movie journalism to keep it alive.

Added to this overwhelming narrative is the fact that the show is a meta-spoof of crime shows. Whenever Turner and Green show up, the show’s lighting changes to the type of over-exposed fluorescence that defines procedurals, making “Interior Chinatown” feel like two different shows smashing into each other. One feels like discarded episodes of “Angie Tribeca,” and the other feels like a semi-grounded bildungsroman about Wu’s self-exploration.\n\nWith that meta-approach, the show will probably be compared to AMC’s short-lived “Kevin Can Go F*** Himself” in format, if not content. That show juxtaposed the husband’s sitcom existence against his wife’s gritty, realistic life in ways that were always interesting to think about but less interesting to actually watch. “Interior Chinatown” suffers from the same problem. It’s a great pitch but a less realized exploration.\n\nThe conceit is obvious, even from the episodic titles—“Generic Asian Man,” “Delivery Guy,” “Tech Guy,” etc. Yu is trying to dismantle the cliches and stereotypes that have defined Asian characters in shows and movies. Yet in five out of ten episodes screened for review, the narrative is frantic in a way that makes the overarching mystery hard to track.\n\nIt doesn’t help that Wu’s self-discovery is essentially staged as levels in a video game. In one episode, he has to break into the evidence locker, constantly repeating the process as he gets closer and closer to distracting the officers and janitors from giving himself time to look for clues related to his brother.\n\nIn ‘Kevin’ there was never a sense that the husband’s heighted-sitcom life was actual reality. That, at least, grounded the show in a firm point of view, even as it played off the juxtaposition between invention and reality. Here, it’s hard to tell what we ashouldview as the narrative ‘truth,’ decreasing the stakes of Wu’ and Lee’s investigation. It doesn’t help that there doesn’t seem to be any actual repercussions when the two fail.\n\nMore compelling and amusing are the subplots related to Fatty and Wu’s parents. Here, we still have questions about what type of show they exist in, but we also have a better sense of how people are placed into cultural, racial, and economic boxes and how they attempt to break out of those stereotypes. Fatty’s elevation to the role of ‘angry waiter’ at the restaurant, which brings in a multitude of white hipsters to revel in being yelled at, is quite funny, even if it’s one-note. The same goes for Lily, who tries to get her real-estate license and give her family some financial security.\n\n“Interior Chinatown” is never anything less than interesting, but it also never gives the sense that it has fully thought through the relationship between its formal/technical choices and content. Perhaps the back half of the miniseries will answer some of these questions. But, halfway through, it feels under-realized. [C+]\n\n“Interior Chinatown” is streaming on Hulu now.",
        "summary": "\"Interior Chinatown,\" adapted from Charles Yu's 2020 novel, is a TV series that explores minority representation in police procedurals through a mix of contrasting tones and styles. The show follows Willis Wu, a background actor and waiter in Chinatown, who becomes entangled in a crime procedural spoof while trying to break free from cultural stereotypes. Wu teams up with detective Lana Lee to solve the mystery of his missing brother, navigating a narrative that feels like a blend of a meta-spoof and a bildungsroman. The series is compared to \"Kevin Can Go F*** Himself\" for its juxtaposition of different realities, but it struggles with a frantic narrative that makes the overarching mystery hard to follow. Despite its intriguing premise, \"Interior Chinatown\" is critiqued for not fully realizing the relationship between its technical choices and content, leaving some questions unanswered halfway through the series.",

On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.\n\nThe high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.\n\nInvestors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nInadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court's action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.\n\nMeta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.\n\nCambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against Nvidia. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency.",

The lawsuit claims Meta failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, leading to significant stock price drops in 2018.

Meta has already paid significant fines and settlements related to the scandal, but maintains that the lawsuit's claims are baseless.

        "content": "As the Twitter-like social network Bluesky sees a significant surge in users this month, Meta’s own X competitor Threads has been rapidly building out its platform. On Friday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced that Threads will start testing AI-powered summaries of what people are discussing on the platform in the app’s “Trending now” section in the U.S.\n\nThe new addition sounds similar to X’s Stories feature, which uses Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok to summarize trending topics in the social network’s Explore section.\n\nThreads is also going to test an expanded set of trending topics, the company noted. Plus, users will now be able to search within a specific date range and search for posts from an individual account.\n\nIn a post on Threads, Mosseri said the additions are “long-overdue improvements to Search and Trending Now on Threads.”\n\nMeta has been moving quickly to update Threads at a time when many X users are moving to Bluesky, which has now surpassed 20 million users. The platform has seen an increase in users following the U.S. presidential election as X gained more of a right-wing approach, especially after Musk used the social network to campaign for President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nAfter complaints from users regarding Threads’ algorithm, the platform is now embracing feedback, as it rolled out changes this week to surface more content from people you follow in the app’s algorithmic feed.\n\nEarlier this week, the social network rolled out custom feeds to allow Threads users to curate feeds around specific topics or certain user profiles. The tool allows Threads to compete with Bluesky’s own features that let users build their own algorithms, feeds, and lists.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Threads’ user base is still much larger than Bluesky’s as it has more than 275 million monthly active users. However, data from market intelligence firm Similarweb shows that Bluesky is catching up with Threads when it comes to daily active users. The firm believes that if the social network is able to keep up its current growth rate, it could eventually catch up with Threads.",
        "summary": "Bluesky is experiencing a significant increase in users, while Meta's Threads is rapidly enhancing its platform to compete with X. Threads is introducing AI-powered summaries for trending topics and expanding its trending topics feature, along with improved search capabilities. These updates are part of Meta's efforts to retain users as many X users migrate to Bluesky, which has surpassed 20 million users. Threads has also introduced custom feeds to allow users to curate content, competing with similar features on Bluesky.

        "content": "The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta, stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.\n\nThe justices heard arguments in November in Meta's bid to shut down the lawsuit. On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.\n\nThe high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.\n\nInvestors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nInadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court's action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.\n\nMeta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.\n\nCambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against Nvidia. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency.",

The lawsuit claims Meta failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, leading to significant stock price drops in 2018. The Supreme Court dismissed Meta's appeal, upholding a lower court's decision to allow the case to continue. Meta has already paid significant fines and settlements related to the scandal, but maintains that the lawsuit's claims are baseless. This case is one of two involving tech companies facing class-action lawsuits, with the other involving Nvidia and its alleged misleading of investors about its cryptocurrency-related sales.",

        "content": "The Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) recent decision to impose a hefty fine on Meta for its anti-competitive practices marks a significant milestone in India’s regulatory landscape. At the heart of this case is WhatsApp’s 2021 Privacy Policy, which mandated data sharing between WhatsApp and other Meta entities. This move, rightly deemed coercive, stripped users of meaningful choice and exposed the inherent vulnerabilities in India’s digital governance framework.\n\nThe CCI’s decision underscores the increasing importance of privacy as a competitive parameter. By addressing the exploitation of network effects and absence of viable alternatives, the regulator has spotlighted the monopolistic tendencies of dominant players like Meta. The CCI’s intervention broadens the scope of competition law to encompass consumer autonomy and data protection —aligning with global regulatory trends. As digital markets evolve, privacy is no longer just a matter of individual rights but a competitive differentiator that shapes market dynamics. By emphasizing this, the CCI has taken a crucial step toward ensuring that India’s digital economy evolves in a manner that respects both consumer rights and fair competition. Secondly, the ruling sends a strong message to tech giants operating in India: exploitative practices that undermine user sovereignty will face stringent scrutiny. For users, this ensures greater transparency and control over personal data while setting a precedent for how dominant platforms must balance commercial interests with consumer welfare.\n\nHowever, this landmark decision also exposes glaring gaps in India’s digital governance framework. While the CCI has acted decisively, the lack of a robust data protection law remains a significant impediment. The Personal Data Protection Law, which has been languishing for years, is yet to be implemented. This legislative inertia stands in stark contrast to Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been a game-changer in holding tech giants accountable. For instance, WhatsApp’s controversial privacy policy was not implemented in Europe due to GDPR restrictions. In India, however, the absence of similar protections allowed Meta to impose terms that exploited the imbalance between its vast resources and the limited agency of its users. This disparity underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive data protection framework in India, one that complements the CCI’s efforts and prevents regulatory overlap or conflicts.\n\nIndia’s response to data breaches and privacy violations by tech giants has historically been lacklustre. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, which compromised the data of millions of Indian users, elicited only verbal condemnations from the government. In contrast, the United States imposed a record $5 billion fine on Facebook, demonstrating the power of decisive action. If India is to protect its citizens and foster a truly competitive digital economy, it must have a robust regulatory framework that integrates competition law with stringent data protection measures.",

The ruling emphasizes consumer autonomy and data protection, sending a strong message to tech giants about the scrutiny of exploitative practices.

        "content": "Is the Fisch Wormhole Enchant worth it? This guide explores its potential when paired with The Rod of The Depths!\n\nYou’ve just fished up the Roblox game link! For more fishy guides, check out our Fisch Rod Progression Guide and Roblox Fisch Rod Tier List.\n\nFisch Wormhole Enchant Guide\n\nThe Rod of The Depths added during The Depths update is a late-game rod with well-balanced stats and a unique ability. Obtaining it requires a visit through The Depths Maze, an Abyssal and Hexed Enchant Relic and 750,000 C$.\n\nSo, what does this have to do with the Wormhole Enchant? Well, players discovered that if The Rod of The Depths gains this enchant, it heightens its built-in ability and helps cheese high-rarity fish such as Sharks outside of their events and the Spectral Serpents.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nBacktracking to the passive of this rod, when held, a spirit of the player taking the appearance of their current avatar floats behind them. Every three catches, the ghost reels in a fish alongside the player. Meanwhile, the Wormhole Enchant has a 45% chance to catch a fish from any location per pull.\n\nThe idea is to have the Wormhole trigger at the same time as the ghost to double the random odds. But, given Fisch has numerous islands and a massive Bestiary, it’s hard to refine the hunt to Mythics.\n\nTo counter this, players pop an Aurora Totem (500,000 C$ from the Brine Pool) to gain x6 Universal Luck. And/or visit Merlin atop Sunstone Island to buy stacks of +30% Luck lasting 10 minutes for 5,000 C$ per.\n\nWith the rod, mutation and luck boosts, only then do players encounter sought-after fish. Though it comes with a hefty price and no guarantee. But, if you do snag something like the Spectral Serpent, you’ll have an easier time catching it than with the Reinforced Rod! So… Silver linings and all that.\n\nIs It Worth The Investment?\n\nIf you’re a late-game player with money to spare then sure! The Rod of The Depths isn’t easy to obtain, nor is the expensive Aurora Totem to pair with it. In total, you’re looking to spend 1,250,000 C$ on rod and totem alone without the cost of supplies to find the rod, or how many relics you’d burn through before getting the Wormhole enchant.",
        "summary": "The guide discusses the potential benefits of pairing the Fisch Wormhole Enchant with The Rod of The Depths in a Roblox game. The Rod of The Depths is a late-game fishing rod with unique abilities, requiring significant resources to obtain. When enhanced with the Wormhole Enchant, the rod's ability to catch high-rarity fish, like Sharks and Spectral Serpents, is improved. Players can further increase their chances by using an Aurora Totem and purchasing luck boosts, although this strategy involves a substantial investment. Ultimately, the enchantment is recommended for late-game players with ample resources, as it offers advantages despite its high cost and lack of guaranteed success.",

        "content": "Chairperson of Competition Commission of India Ravneet Kaur on Friday hinted that the competition watchdog is not likely to take cognizance of the media reports on US authorities indicting Gautam Adani on bribery charges to initiate an investigation into the matter, saying CCI can take action only after “some information” is filed before it.\n\n“The CCI is governed by the Competition Act. It is meant to promote and sustain competition. If there is any matter which falls into that domain of the Competition Act, then it comes to the Competition Commission,” Kaur replied to media queries on whether the Adani matter falls under the purview of the Competition Commission of India.\n\nUS prosecutors have indicted billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani for paying $265 million in bribes to Indian officials to secure solar energy contracts.\n\nA five-count criminal indictment was filed at a federal court in Brooklyn charging Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani, Vneet Jaain and several others, for their role in a multi-billion dollar scheme to obtain funds from US investors and global financial institutions on the basis of false and misleading statements.\n\nReplying to a question on whether the allegations are in the nature of anti-competitive conduct, Kaur said, “I am not aware of that. These are all media reports and I am not able to respond to that.”\n\nKaur was speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of an event organised by the Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce & Industry in Kolkata.\n\nOn whether the CCI would take cognizance of the media reports on the Adani matter, Kaur said, “No, we don’t take cognizance of the media reports. We have to have some information which is filed before us, and then the commission takes action on that.”\n\nAn Adani group spokesperson denied the US authorities allegations and claimed that it was baseless, and all legal recourse will be sought.\n\nThe Competition Commission of India has recently imposed a penalty of ₹213.14 crore on Meta for abusing its dominant position. The penalty pertains to the controversial implementation of WhatsApp’s 2021 Privacy Policy, which mandated data sharing between WhatsApp and other Meta companies, raising serious concerns about user autonomy and market fairness.\n\nReferring to the WhatsApp case, Kaur said it was a “very important aspect” as there has been very rapid development of the landscape because of digital transformation. “So we have these big tech companies. Then, not only the big tech companies, even the industry is adopting more digital outreach, more practices which are based on AI and digital services. So in that kind of a landscape, it becomes even more important for us to understand what the competition law requires,” she emphasised.\n\nMeta has said it would file an appeal challenging the decision of the CCI.",
        "summary": "Ravneet Kaur, Chairperson of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), indicated that the CCI is unlikely to investigate media reports about US authorities indicting Gautam Adani on bribery charges, as the CCI requires formal information to take action. The CCI operates under the Competition Act, which focuses on promoting and sustaining competition, and Kaur stated that the Adani case does not currently fall under its jurisdiction based on available information. US prosecutors have charged Gautam Adani and others with bribery and misleading investors, but an Adani group spokesperson denied the allegations. Kaur emphasized that the CCI does not act on media reports alone and needs formal filings to proceed with investigations. Additionally, the CCI recently fined Meta for abusing its dominant position related to WhatsApp's 2021 Privacy Policy, highlighting the importance of understanding competition law in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.",

        "content": "If you’re looking for a new TV ahead of 2025 TV premieres, some Star Wars LEGO sets, streaming service discounts and more for the holiday season, checking out the best Black Friday deals is a great way to save money while treating yourself and/or others. (But mostly you.) And getting that entertainment jolt doesn’t even have to take place solely in the physical world, but also in virtual reality with the Meta Quest 3 and more advanced 3S, the perfect gift for movie fans and would-be Batman.\n\nEasily the most user-friendly option for VR beginners and enthusiasts, the Quest devices are also among the most budget-friendly as well. And even though Meta doesn’t yet have any Black Friday deals announced for the systems themselves outside of some accessory options, the recent price adjustments tied to the 3S’ release still count as pretty huge deal all on its own that should be taken advantage of ASAP.\n\nMeta Quest 3 512GB With Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle: $649 $499.99 At Amazon\n\nNot technically a Black Friday deal, the Meta Quest 3 still saw its price recalibrated following the release of the new 3S model, making it more affordable. And this bundle is one for movie fans who want to give Batman: Arkham Shadow a go alongside a 3-month free trial of Quest+.\n\nThough the Meta Quest 3S isn't discounted at this time, the $299 price tag for the 128GB model is a full $200 cheaper than the older 3 model's original price ($499) for the same amount of storage. More bang for fewer bucks is the best kind of math.\n\nGet The Most Immersive Batman Experience Ever\n\nA big bonus that comes equipped with each of the above Meta Quest purchases is the Caped Crusader's latest video game adventure, Batman: Arkham Shadow. It's a sequel to 2016's fun-but-limited Batman: Arkham VR, and a narrative follow-up to the franchise prequel Batman: Arkham Origins from 2013.\n\nThis is THE experience for anyone who's ever wanted to feel as close as possible to being the Dark Knight, in VR and with an all-star cast of voice actors bringing your favorite DC heroes and villains to life. Considering the price of the game alone is $50, that means the Meta Quest 3S is really just $249, which makes it as inexpensive as any video game platform out there.\n\nEnjoy Movies On A \"Big\" Screen Like No Other\n\n\"Not all apps are created equal\" is an absolute truth when it comes to VR, and not all streaming services and video platforms were quick to perfect their Meta Quest efforts. But now we're at a point where a virtual reality device can add a new dimension for anyone with a Netflix subscription a Peacock subscription and/or plenty of others.\n\nDepending on what app you're using, you could be watching your favorite movies in a digital theater, in a pixilated bedroom, in an alien spaceship, or somewhere more down to earth. For those who don't care about such surroundings, VR helmets make it easy to fill one's vision with entertainment whether you're sitting, standing or lying down.\n\nRecently, the company introduced an option for Quest users to join up and watch YouTube with friends in a virtual environment. (YouTube also offers the largest number of 360-degree videos online.)\n\nBlack Friday Deals For Meta Quest-Compatible Accessories\n\nHaving a Meta Quest 3 or 3S may work fine out of the box, but frequent gamers and movie-watchers are probably going to want to shell out a little more money for docking stations and cables that will help make the non-gaming times go by quicker.\n\nMeta Quest 3 Charging Dock: $129.99 $99.99 At Amazon\n\nAn absolute essential for any Meta Quest 3 owners, the charging dock is minimalist and sleek, helping to keep your space organized and your VR headset juiced up. The docking station comes with rechargable batteries for your Touch Plus controls, as well as LED display to let you know when your headset and controllers are fulling charged.\n\nUpcoming Meta Quest 3 Games For Movie, TV And Music Fans\n\nI've championed the Meta Quest 2 in recent years for its lineup of games and experiences that match up well with frequent movie goers and TV hounds, and that same excitement has ported upwards to the Meta Quest 3 and 3S. Here are some of the new and upcoming games that both games and non-gamers can get into.\n\nAction Hero - TBA 2024\n\nAlien: Rogue Incursion - Dec. 19, 2024\n\nBatman: Arkham Shadow - October 22, 2024\n\nExploding Kittens VR - October 3, 2024\n\nJust Dance VR - October 15, 2024\n\nMobile Suit Gundam: Silver Phantom - October 3, 2024\n\nStarship Troopers: Continuum - October 17, 2024\n\nTaskmaster VR - TBA 2024\n\nWallace And Gromit's Jamtastic! - TBA\n\nKeep checking back with CinemaBlend for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals that movie and TV fans should be excited about. And don't forget to stay safe when you have a VR helmet on, since you can't buy common sense on sale or otherwise.",

But how about a futuristic pair of sunglasses that can take photos, record videos, make calls, listen to music, send messages and perform countless other tasks? If that sounds like your jam, then take advantage of this Black Friday offer on a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses in black for just $263. Typically found at well over the $300 mark, a 20% discount has been applied across a range of colors and styles.\n\nIf black isn't your thing, the glasses can be picked up for the same $263 cost in shiny caramel. Alternatively, you can save an extra $24 and pick up a pair in black and green for $239. Every color here is the cheapest we have on record, with two different size options in large or regular available.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nCNET editor at-large Scott Stein found the Meta Ray-Bans to be \"somewhat astonishing at times\" in his review, highlighting how they make \"wonderful vacation companions and memory makes.\" More so, he noted how the tech doesn't focus on AI too heavily: \"What I love about Meta's smart glasses is that AI is a whimsical bonus. These are glasses first and cameras/headphones second -- and pretty good ones at that.\"\n\nThey're also extremely good headphones for voice calls and podcasts, with excellent microphones. They're good for playing music as well, but keep in mind that the open design of the speaker placement means they're hard to use in noisy places. Meta's Ray-Bans can also be outfitted with various sunglass lens inserts or prescription lenses, just like regular glasses.\n\nWhile Meta will continue to add new features to its smart glasses over time, these Ray-Bans aren't being updated anytime soon, so this discount is well worth acting on.\n\nWhy this deal matters\n\nAdvanced technology like Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses can be extremely pricey. After all, it's all brand-new and shiny so anyone trying them out is very much a pioneer in these early days. So if you've been holding off making the leap to next-gen, this is a great time with all these variations reaching a new low price, thanks to a 20% cut at Amazon. Not a bad way to treat someone close (or even yourself) this holiday season, either.\n\nWant to check out the competition?

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent Meta, stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.\n\nThe justices heard arguments in November in Meta's bid to shut down the lawsuit. On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.\n\nThe high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.\n\nInvestors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nInadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court's action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.\n\nMeta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.\n\nCambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against Nvidia. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency.",

The lawsuit claims Meta failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, leading to significant drops in its stock price in 2018. Meta has already paid substantial fines and settlements related to privacy issues, but continues to defend itself against the investors' claims. Cambridge Analytica, linked to Trump strategist Steve Bannon, accessed data from millions of Facebook users to influence the 2016 U.S. election.

        "content": "Get the most epic Quest this holiday season with early Black Friday deals from Kiwi Design, my favorite Meta Quest accessory company. I've recently received all the latest from the company and everything is on sale well ahead of Black Friday including 25% off my new favorite head strap. It works with BOTH the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, so there's no need to figure out an exact model.\n\nThe Kiwi Design H4 is the company's brand new halo-style strap that is designed to take weight off your face with an easily adjustable strap that has ample padding for your forehead and the back of your head.\n\nBetter yet, it features quality batteries from Amprius Technologies in Fremont, California, including dual USB-PD charging tech that ensures your Meta Quest gets the correct voltage at all times and doesn't get overcharged. That battery not only adds hours of additional playtime but also helps better balance out the head strap for added comfort.\n\nKiwi Design H4 head strap: was $79.99 now $59.99 at Amazon Add battery life and comfort to your Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S with the best halo-style head strap you can buy. Thanks to an early Black Friday 2024 sale, this one is a cool 25% off.\n\n✅Recommended if: You like to play long VR sessions and need more comfort or longer battery life.\n\n❌Skip this deal if: You only play for 30 minutes or so at a time or are already comfortable with the head strap you've got.\n\nMy previous favorite head strap was the BoboVR M3 Pro but Kiwi Design's strap adds tweaks the strap design in a way that's far more comfortable. Not only is it higher up and larger, but that forehead padding is adjustable via a handy dial in the front.\n\nKiwi also thought of plenty of other niceties like a rigid front connector — instead of the annoying cloth Velcro one most head straps use — as well as a battery that intelligently adjusts voltage to ensure your headset gets the right amount of power without that annoying hissing sound some batteries make.\n\nWhile you're adding extra comfort to your Quest 3 or 3S, you should also grab a pair of Kiwi Design G4 Pro controller straps. They're 20% off right now and are the most comfortable controller grips I've ever used.\n\nThey not only add important grip and padding to the Quest 3 or Quest 3S controllers — which are a little too compact for my liking — but the hand strap is a luxuriously soft cloth that feels similar to one of those extra-soft blankets you might have on your couch.\n\nKiwi Design G4 Pro controller grips: was $29.99 now $23.99 at Amazon Get a grip and get the best controller grips I've ever used for 20% off! These work with the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S controllers, adding grip, a supple and soft hand strap, and convenient battery doors so you don't have to remove them to swap out the battery.\n\n✅Recommended if: You tend to drop the Quest 3 or Quest 3S's controllers, or just find them uncomfortable/too small.\n\n❌Skip this deal if: You use a dock to charge your controllers. Most grips aren't compatible with a dock.\n\nThese grips also have a convenient battery door on the side so you don't have to remove them just to swap out the controller battery every so often. If you haven't used controller grips yet, you're seriously not ready for how much better these make things. It's unreal!\n\nKiwi Design also has its V3 facial interface replacement on sale which is a lot more comfortable than the default facial interface shape and padding. This isn't just a silicone pad you put over top of the original facial interface, it's a full replacement that also adds ventilation to keep the Quest 3's lenses from fogging up during play.\n\nPlus, it's 20% off right now during Kiwi Design's early Black Friday sale. The V3 ONLY works for the Meta Quest 3, though, so if you have a Quest 3S you'll want to grab the Kiwi Design V4 facial interface, instead.\n\n✅Recommended if: The default face pad isn't comfortable for any reason or your lenses get fogged up while playing.\n\n❌Skip this deal if: You find PU leather uncomfortable.\n\nThe supple padding both wicks away sweat and is super easy to clean thanks to the PU leather material it's made of. The padding is easily removed and reinstalled via a Velcro backing, and most other face pads fit without issue. If you've already got some face pads lying around from other Quest headsets, they should work on this one.\n\nTwo pads come in the pack so it's easy to swap pads when you swap the headset, ensuring you're only sharing fun, not sweat.\n\nBlack Friday doesn't officially start until November 29, 2024, but there's no reason to wait until then to outfit your Quest 3 or Quest 3S with the best accessories. We don't ever see deals better than these, so you might as well jump on them now if you've been considering upgrading your headset this year.",

        "publish_date": "2024-11-21T20:14:20Z",
        "content": "The theme of Hearthstone's latest card expansion, which is called The Great Dark Beyond, is building and launching increasingly powerful Starships. Unfortunately those sci-fi shenanigans have not been happening nearly enough for Blizzard's liking, largely because a bunch of older cards and decks are so powerful that they've crowded out the new stuff. Which is why Team 5's latest balance patch, which is live now, features a whopping 15 nerfs and 14 buffs aimed at getting the meta moving.\n\nYou can read the details here but the headline changes are to Quasar and Reno, Lone Ranger, both of which have been deservedly nuked from orbit for being two of the most toxic cards ever printed. Let's start with Quasar. It's a Rogue spell that reads: 'Shuffle your hand into your deck. Reduce the Cost of cards in your deck by (3).' The deck archetype that was created by Quasar involved using egregious amounts of card draw and burn spells to refill your hand and cheese your opponent out of the game.\n\nThe experiences when this card does work are too sharp and end games too early, turning the dream into a nightmare to play against. —Blizzard\n\nWas it super powerful? Not really. Quasar's Rogue's win rate according to HSReplay.net is hovering around the 40% mark, and the Vicious Syndicate Data Reaper report ranks it as a Tier 4 deck (which is the lowest). However, did Quasar feel absolutely obnoxious to lose to, as you watched your opponent draw their entire deck and cast a bazillion discounted damage spells? Absolutely. And from the content creators and players I follow, pretty much everyone but the degenerates piloting the deck seemed to agree that Quasar should never have been printed.\n\n\"Yeah, our bad…\" reads the Blizzard blog post explaining the nerf. \"Every expansion we like to make a few 'dreamy' cards that get players thinking about how far they can push the game. These cards aren’t supposed to be the most competitively viable; the fun of them is wondering 'what if.' Quasar mostly fell into that category—it certainly got the dreamers cooking and it hasn’t turned out to be a competitive power outlier—but the experiences when this card does work are too sharp and end games too early, turning the dream into a nightmare to play against.\"\n\nAnd so the hammer fell. Quasar now costs 8-Mana to cast, up from 6 previously. That kind of Mana increase is effectively the same as deleting the card. A strategy that was already sub-optimal will now be all but impossible, and the game will be better for it.\n\nHave you been injured by this man while playing card games? Join our Reno Jackson class action lawsuit today. (Image credit: Blizzard)\n\nAlso getting kicked into another solar system is Reno, Lone Ranger. It's a neutral Hero card (ie it replaces your current hero power) that previously read: \"Battlecry: If your deck started with no duplicates, empty the enemy board and limit it to 1 space for a turn.\" That effect amounted to fully resetting your opponent's board state. Reno even removed Dormant minions and Location cards, without triggering any Deathrattle effects in the process. Now, not only has the restriction that your opponent could only play a single minion on the following turn been removed, Locations and Dormant minions will remain in place.\n\nHere's the Blizzard's spiel: \"Reno has been a polarizing card since its release. He’s a necessarily strong payoff to singleton decks, which many players really enjoy, but playing against him can be really frustrating—especially his next turn board limitation. It’s been difficult to balance these competing player interests, and we don’t make this change lightly, but we felt Reno was due for an update (to no longer hit non-minions, Dormant minions, etc.) so we could give Starships a better chance to fly.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nGiven that Reno already restricted your deck-building to not including duplicates, at 10 Mana it now looks wildly over-costed and play should plummet. Reno was such a hard counter to Starships, because you could spend many turns building yours only to see it go *poof* with no reward whatsoever. Again, that felt terrible, and Blizzard is correct to balance around play experience as well as pure power.\n\nStarships will also get a helping hand from some of the buffs being dealt out, most notably to The Exodar, which auto-launches your Starship along with one of three bonus effects. It's cost is dropping from 8 to 7 Mana, and its stats are changing from 6/10 to 6/8. That seems like a very good deal. \"This last change is particularly spicy,\" said Blizzard. \"We wanted to make sure that Starships got a chance to shine, but we’ll keep an eye on this one after all the changes go live to make sure we didn’t push too far.\" Don't worry, when has buffing cards ever got Blizzard into trouble?!\n\nAs usual, all the nerfed cards will be eligible for full dust refunds for two weeks from today.",
        "summary": "The latest Hearthstone card expansion, \"The Great Dark Beyond,\" focuses on building and launching powerful Starships, but older cards have overshadowed the new content, prompting Blizzard to implement a balance patch with 15 nerfs and 14 buffs. Notably, the Quasar card, a Rogue spell, has been heavily nerfed due to its frustrating gameplay experience, despite not being overly powerful statistically. Similarly, Reno, Lone Ranger, a neutral Hero card, has been adjusted to reduce its oppressive impact on opponents, particularly affecting Starship strategies. The patch also includes buffs to cards like The Exodar to enhance Starship gameplay, with its cost reduced and stats adjusted. Blizzard aims to improve the overall play experience and ensure new strategies have a chance to thrive, offering full dust refunds for nerfed cards for a limited time.",

        "content": "CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday reiterated his longstanding belief in Nvidia and CEO Jensen Huang, saying that despite the concerns of some on Wall Street, demand for the artificial intelligence behemoth's products isn't slowing down.\n\n\"The demand is accelerating because the payoff is so great,\" he said. \"According to Jensen, for every dollar their customers put in, they're making five smackers. That means they have no choice but to buy Nvidia's chips.\"\n\nNvidia posted earnings Wednesday that comfortably topped estimates. Shares dipped in extended trading and traded unevenly during Thursday's session, but the stock managed to finish the day up 0.53%. Nvidia has had a meteoric rise, with shares currently up more than 196% year-to-date, and the company has posted large earnings beats quarter after quarter. But some investors worry the AI juggernaut won't be able to keep up the rapid growth.\n\nAccording to Cramer, supply isn't set to outpace demand. Some of Nvidia's biggest customers, like Microsoft , Meta , Amazon and Tesla will have to keep buying the products, he said.\n\nCramer described why he thinks Nvidia is well-positioned, saying it has strong business in both AI and accelerated computing, saying there's \"a trillion dollars worth of computing power that needs to be replaced by Nvidia.\" And Nvidia can help the enterprise save enormous amounts of money by easing tasks including legal work, supply chain management, engineering and coding, he added.\n\n\"What's happening at Nvidia is so positive that it defies description,\" Cramer said. \"Our minds can't comprehend it.\"\n\nNvidia declined to comment.",
        "summary": "Jim Cramer reaffirmed his confidence in Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasizing that demand for Nvidia's AI products is increasing due to their high return on investment. Nvidia's recent earnings exceeded expectations, and despite some fluctuations, its stock has risen significantly, up over 196% year-to-date.

        "content": "If we’re all the heroes of our own stories, that’s generally as it should be. Such a belief is often what motivates us to shape our lives and find meaning in them. How someone might think otherwise and how it can be corrected is the primary concern of Charles Yu’s Interior Chinatown.\n\nBased on Yu’s book of the same name, it doesn’t so much rewrite a tired premise as attempt to dissect how such premises came to be, and how they sometimes keep people from stepping out of their designated places. If the show isn’t quite a scathing indictment of assimilation and the racist expectations therein, it at least makes its emphasis on the comedic murder mystery a fun, intriguing ride, as waiter and aspiring actor Willis Wu (Jimmy O. Yang) struggles to step into the spotlight of his own life.\n\nIn the proud tradition of “careful what you wish for,” Willis proclaims his desire to become something besides the background character in someone else’s story just in time to witness an abduction, and he’s quickly pulled into a police procedural that has ties to Chinatown crime lords and his brother’s mysterious disappearance 12 years ago, complete with Law & Order-esque flourishes. There’s a whole lot to dissect in how someone like Willis is seen—or more often, not seen—in your stereotypical crime drama.\n\nProduced by Taika Waititi, Interior Chinatown has much of his signature tongue-in-cheek flourishes, as it also satirizes cop shows and the roles Asian Americans typically occupy in pop culture. Its ambitions don’t quite live up to what Yu accomplished in the source material, which had the benefit of not only exploring the interiority of its setting, but the spaces its characters were restricted to with a delicately savage touch. It’s a tough transition, taking that approach to an onscreen space, but Yu (who is also the showrunner) makes it riveting. TV-MA, ten 35–45-min episodes\n\nHulu",
        "summary": "\"Interior Chinatown,\" based on Charles Yu's book, explores themes of identity and assimilation through the story of Willis Wu, a waiter and aspiring actor. The show dissects how societal expectations can confine individuals to certain roles, using a comedic murder mystery as its backdrop.

        "content": "Some major tech companies including Meta are taking steps to combat “pig butchering” scams, which trick Americans out of billions of dollars each year through fake online friendships and romances.\n\nPig butchering scams are elaborate and often take months to unfold. Scammers will patiently strike up an online friendship or romantic relationship with a victim, eventually guiding them to invest in elaborate fake cryptocurrency ventures. Victims become convinced they’ve found a way to get rich and sometimes give away their entire savings before realizing it was all a scam.\n\nMeta on Thursday announced it has taken its first major steps into addressing the scams, including dedicating staff to identify where scammers operate, sharing that information with international law enforcement, and taking down more than 2 million accounts this year.\n\nPig butchering scammers use a wide range of apps, including meeting victims on dating apps and guiding them to chat on Telegram, which is relatively unmoderated and reluctant to work with international law enforcement. But some scammers meet targets on Facebook and Instagram or chat with them on WhatsApp.\n\nTelegram did not respond to a request for comment. Since its owner’s arrest in France in August, it has changed its terms of service to say that it will sometimes cooperate with law enforcement.\n\nScam reports have risen steadily in recent years. In September, the FBI announced that victims had filed reports of losing a record amount — nearly $4 billion — in crypto investment scams, a category that primarily refers to pig butchering. Given that many victims don’t report to the FBI, the actual losses are likely much higher.\n\nMeta will begin automatically flagging potential scam messages when strangers message people over Facebook Messenger or Instagram DMs, or add them to a WhatsApp group, it said.\n\nThe announcement reflects how more tech companies are recognizing the severity of pig butchering scams.\n\nMeta recently took down a ring of accounts that appeared to come from a compound in Cambodia after being alerted to it through OpenAI, which found that the scammers had been trying to use ChatGPT to translate their messages to victims. They were also using ChatGPT to generate social media posts, an OpenAI spokesperson said.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta, Tinder and Hinge owner Match Group, and several cryptocurrency companies announced a coalition to make their first major joint effort to tackle the problem. Calling themselves the Tech Against Scams coalition, the companies pledged to share scammer information with each other and better educate users.\n\nJeff Lunglhofer, the chief information officer of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, told NBC News that while it was unclear how long it would take to make a serious dent in pig butchering and other scams, sharing information with other tech companies was a necessary step.\n\n“Many of the initial outreaches are on platforms like Instagram,” he said. “You very quickly get taken to the Telegrams and kind of get moved around a little bit so that they’re hard to track. But we understand that working with those folks and collaborating with them and sharing information is really the only way we’re going to holistically address this as an industry.”\n\nSome scam fighters find tech companies' efforts to fight pig butchering too little and too late, however.\n\nJake Sims, a co-founder of Operation Shamrock, a global coalition working to fight scams and the criminal networks that underpin them, said that proactively warning users about potential scams and periodically taking down accounts fail to cover the extent of criminal activity taking place.\n\n“Given the scale of the problem, this sort of reactive response is not proportional to the crime,” Sims told NBC News.\n\n“After three years of Meta’s awareness of this problem on their platforms, the situation is getting worse, not better,” he said.",
        "summary": "Major tech companies, including Meta, are taking steps to combat \"pig butchering\" scams, which involve scammers forming fake online relationships to trick victims into investing in fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes. Meta has dedicated staff to identify scammers, shared information with international law enforcement, and removed over 2 million accounts this year. These scams often start on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and dating apps, with scammers moving victims to less moderated apps like Telegram. Despite efforts from tech companies and the formation of the Tech Against Scams coalition, some critics argue that these measures are insufficient given the scale of the problem. Reports of crypto investment scams have increased, with the FBI noting nearly $4 billion in reported losses, and many victims likely not reporting their losses.",

        "content": "Skip to comments.\n\nVenting Doesn't Reduce Anger, But Something Else Does, Study Shows\n\nScience Alert ^ | 21 November 2024 | Russell McLendon\n\nPosted on by beaversmom\n\nVenting when angry seems sensible. Conventional wisdom suggests expressing anger can help us quell it, like releasing steam from a pressure cooker.\n\nBut this common metaphor is misleading, according to a recent meta-analytic review. Researchers at Ohio State University analyzed 154 studies on anger, finding little evidence that venting helps. In some cases, it could increase anger.\n\n\"I think it's really important to bust the myth that if you're angry you should blow off steam – get it off your chest,\" said senior author and communication scientist Brad Bushman when the results were published in April.\n\n\"Venting anger might sound like a good idea, but there's not a shred of scientific evidence to support catharsis theory.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean anger should be ignored. Reflection can help us understand why we get mad and address underlying problems. It can also aid emotional validation, an important first step towards healthily processing emotions.\n\nVenting, however, often goes beyond reflection into rumination. The study suggests that many people also try to exorcize anger with physical exertion, which can offer health benefits but may not lighten the mood in the moment.\n\nThe studies reviewed included a total of 10,189 participants, representing a variety of ages, genders, cultures, and ethnicities. The findings show the key to curbing anger is reducing physiological arousal, the authors say, from anger itself or from the otherwise beneficial physical activity it might inspire.\n\n\"To reduce anger, it is better to engage in activities that decrease arousal levels,\" Bushman said. \"Despite what popular wisdom may suggest, even going for a run is not an effective strategy because it increases arousal levels and ends up being counterproductive.\"\n\nThe research was inspired partly by the popularity of 'rage rooms', where people pay to smash objects in hopes of releasing anger, said first author Sophie Kjærvik, a communication scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\n\"I wanted to debunk the whole theory of expressing anger as a way of coping with it,\" explained Kjærvik. \"We wanted to show that reducing arousal, and actually the physiological aspect of it, is really important.\"\n\nThe team designed the review based on the Schachter-Singer two-factor theory, which describes anger (and all other emotions) as a two-part phenomenon, each comprising a physiological and a cognitive component.\n\nPrevious research has often focused on the cognitive angle, according to Kjærvik and Bushman, like examining how cognitive behavioral therapy can help people adjust the mental meanings underpinning their anger.\n\nResearch shows that can work, they say, but the review also sheds important light on an alternate pathway for defusing fury. What's more, standard cognitive behavioral therapies are not effective for all brain types.\n\nTheir study examined both arousal-increasing and arousal-reducing activities, from boxing, cycling, and jogging to deep breathing, meditating, and yoga.\n\nCalming activities reduced anger in the lab and the field, they found, and across other variables like methods of instruction or participant demographics. Effective arousal-reducing activities included slow-flow yoga, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, and taking a timeout.\n\n\"It was really interesting to see that progressive muscle relaxation and just relaxation in general might be as effective as approaches such as mindfulness and meditation,\" Kjærvik said.\n\n\"And yoga, which can be more arousing than meditation and mindfulness, is still a way of calming and focusing on your breath that has the similar effect in reducing anger.\"\n\nRather than trying to vent anger, the researchers recommend undermining it by turning down the heat. Calming tactics already proven to ease stress may also rob anger of physiological fuel.\n\n\"Obviously in today's society, we're all dealing with a lot of stress, and we need ways of coping with that, too,\" Kjærvik said. \"Showing that the same strategies that work for stress actually also work for anger is beneficial.\"\n\nThe review found that most arousal-boosting activities didn't reduce anger, and some increased it, with jogging most likely to do that.\n\nBall sports and other physical activities involving play seemed to reduce physiological arousal, suggesting exertion might be more useful for reducing anger if it's fun.\n\n\"Certain physical activities that increase arousal may be good for your heart, but they're definitely not the best way to reduce anger,\" said Bushman. \"It's really a battle because angry people want to vent, but our research shows that any good feeling we get from venting actually reinforces aggression.\"\n\nMore research is needed to clarify these findings, but for now, the researchers say calming techniques – even just taking a timeout or counting to 10 – offer the best options for taming a temper.\n\n\"You don't need to necessarily book an appointment with a cognitive behavioral therapist to deal with anger. You can download an app for free on your phone, or you can find a YouTube video if you need guidance,\" Kjærvik said.\n\nThe study was published in Clinical Psychology Review.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in April 2024.\n\n\n\nTOPICS:\n\nHealth/Medicine\n\nScience\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nanger\n\nangerstrategies\n\nrageroom\n\nragerooms\n\nventing\n\nThe leftist, post-Trump-win, rage ladies need to take note.\n\n\n\nTo: beaversmom\n\nJust smoke a joint, it’s legal almost everywhere now.\n\n\n\nTo: beaversmom\n\n“It’s really a battle because angry people want to vent, but our research shows that any good feeling we get from venting actually reinforces aggression.” Maybe that’s part of what works for humanity.\n\n\n\nby 3 posted onby BenLurkin (The above is not a statement of fact.

        "content": "When Meta began pushing mixed reality during last year's Quest 3 launch, I was skeptical. All we had seen up to that point were games where stuff would come out of the walls so you could shoot or grab them. In other words, similar ideas to early VR titles that were fun for 20-30 minutes but lacked any real lasting value.\n\nAC thVRsday In his weekly column, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.\n\nOne year later, the brilliant developers in the Meta Quest ecosystem have proven me very wrong, with three new games proving that mixed reality is more than just a gimmick. I first saw how mixed reality games could change the landscape in February, and these latest releases have completely changed my expectations going forward.\n\nOf course, this has been building throughout the year. Homeworld Vast Reaches debuted with a way to play the entire strategy game in mixed reality, while titles like Starship Home only exist in mixed reality by transforming your four falls into a spaceship.\n\nNow, The Last Stand, Spatial Ops, and Wall Town Wonders are taking the concept even further in ways that totally blew me away, once again adding more games to the never-ending list of must-play Meta Quest 3 games.\n\nTurning your home into a laser tag arena\n\nSpatial Ops is the latest title from Resolution Games, the folks behind Angry Birds VR, Demeo, Racket Club, and several other VR classics. The company is no stranger to mixed reality but this is the first mixed-reality-only game they've built for the Meta Quest platform.\n\nMy family and I had a blast playing the arena mode in the house on a Saturday morning.\n\nSpatial Ops' biggest claim to fame is its ability to turn any large space into a \"laser tag arena,\" for lack of a better term. You set up barriers, weapon spawning locations, and even flags to capture. Arenas can be any size you want, but the bigger the arena, the better your experience will be.\n\nMy home isn't particularly large — it's about 1,000 square feet — and the layout isn't particularly helpful for an arena-style game, but my family and I still had a blast playing the arena mode on a Saturday morning with a Meta Quest 3S, Quest 3, and even a Quest 2.\n\nGet the top Black Friday deals right in your inbox: Sign up now!

I found that Capture the Flag or Point Capture works best for smaller spaces as you can defend a small space effectively, while a free-for-all match mostly feels like chaos.\n\nSpatial Ops' single-player campaign feels like a true next-generation Time Crisis light gun game from the glory days of 2000s arcades.\n\nAnd while the arena mode might be the glitzy mode that gives content creators millions of views, it's the single-player campaign mode that will bring players in for the long haul. In essence, Spatial Ops' single-player campaign feels like a true next-generation Time Crisis light gun game from the glory days of 2000s arcades.\n\nWe've got plenty of light gun games these days, but Spatial Ops sets itself apart by using portals to bring the action to your room in a unique way. Not only do these portals have a unique effect that made me hone my focus on them, but they also appear on any of the four walls in your room as well as on the ceiling.\n\nThis true 360-degree gameplay felt downright incredible, and I found myself smiling constantly during every minute of gameplay. It's got seven chapters in total, each of which will take 20-30 minutes to complete, making it a respectable length without feeling long in the tooth.\n\nat Meta - Influencer Spatial Ops is the next-generation lightgun game you've been waiting for. From portals in your room to whole-home laser tag, you will be amazed.

The best part is that you won't need to install any shelves since all the buildings sit on the wall all by themselves.\n\nIn Wall Town Wonders, you'll be managing a tiny village that resides on the walls of your room. As you'd expect from a village management game, things are a bit more interactive/intimate than you'd expect from a city builder.\n\nWhile there's no direct control over the denizens of your town as is the case in a game like Townsmen VR — meaning you can't pick them up and place them anywhere at any time — there are times when a character will hop on your controller so you can bring them somewhere as part of the game's story.\n\n(Image credit: Cyborn)\n\nYou'll also be directly controlling characters flying planes, riding on the back of miniature (yet giant) lizards, and even combing through mines to dig up ore and other resources. The town simulation isn't relegated to just putting up buildings by any means; your direct input is what will make your town truly thrive.\n\nSome buildings will automatically bring in resources — the restaurant and some shops bring in gold, while smiths and other crafters will bring in their respective resources — but many important resources are gathered through mini-games that you directly control, as well.\n\nI found myself marveling at the miniature lives of the folks who frequented my town, getting up close and personal to see what they were up to when walking in and out of rooms that exist somewhere behind the drywall.\n\nAfter a little while, you'll build a tropical pond on your floor, which houses diving contests and fishing tournaments, all of which you'll play from a giant's perspective. Berry hunting with the ridable lizards sees the little green guys crawling on your walls while tending to the town's garden, which sometimes involves shooting bugs that crawl out of imaginary holes in those same walls.\n\nIt's all very fun and imaginative and marks one of the most charming times I've yet experienced in any VR or mixed-reality game. I found myself marveling at the miniature lives of the folks who frequented my town, getting up close and personal to see what they were up to when walking in and out of rooms that existed somewhere behind the drywall.\n\nNot only is the placement of objects super convincing but there's even a way to adjust the lighting to better match your room if you're really a stickler for realism. Plus, controller and hand-tracking support means you can play this as casually as you want, although I generally found that I preferred controller support for some mini-games.\n\nat Meta - Influencer Build the miniature town of your dreams right on your wall with this groundbreaking mixed reality game. Buy now at Meta Horizon store\n\nNot just another zombie shooter in a mall\n\nThe Last Stand is the...ahem...last game I'll cover today, and I'll keep it mostly brief. That's not because I didn't like it at all — quite the contrary. It's because the game just launched in early access and is best when played in half-hour bouts.\n\nThis one is made by the folks behind Drop Dead: The Cabin and the accompanying Home Invasion mixed reality mode. If anything, The Last Stand feels like the full version of what the team was trying to do with Home Invasion, as the game turns your room into a mall store that you'll need to defend.\n\nThe twist is that another human player is on the other side of the mall, and only one person can walk away with the title \"survivor.\"\n\nYour real furniture can be used to duck behind and protect yourself from virtual gun fire, and that was just super trippy to me.\n\nDeveloper Soul Assembly is currently developing a proper progression game mode, but for now, you can still enjoy defending your store and keeping at the top of the leaderboards, playing rounds with friends or random folks alike.\n\nThe concept alone is interesting enough, but I was impressed by how large my tiny 10ftx10ft guest bedroom felt once The Last Stand attached doorways and windows to the walls. People often add ceiling-to-floor mirrors to make rooms feel larger than they are, but this is a next-level room makeover — well, except for the boarded-up windows and invading zombies, of course.\n\nLooking out at a mall-sized room outside my own room was simply surreal, but taking in the sights doesn't last long as the other player will be shooting at you all while zombies try to consume your brains. Zombie kills equate to cash earned, and the handy tablet you have on your back gets you a quick way to buy better gear and weapons to progress faster.\n\n(Image credit: Soul Assembly)\n\nI also loved being able to designate one wall as the \"main\" wall, which would completely change the look and feel of the room. Soul Assembly says that rooms with more furniture in them are best for this game and that immediately made sense when I picked a wall with no furniture against it. Your real furniture can be used to duck behind and protect yourself from virtual gunfire, and that was just super trippy to me.\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing proper character progression and some other features built out for this one over time. It's only a few bucks, though, which makes it easy to pick up without feeling like you got ripped off.\n\nat Meta - Influencer Your room becomes a mall store that you have to defend against zombies and other players in this stunning mixed reality game from the makers of The Cabin. Buy now at Meta Horizon store\n\nThese three games are just a few examples of how good mixed reality gameplay has gotten, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Many more mixed reality games are coming out before the end of the year, and I expect this class of games will only continue to grow as developers learn how to transform your physical space into new, fun games.\n\nThe best part is that you don't even need the most expensive headset for this since the Meta Quest 3S delivers full-quality mixed-reality gameplay for only $299.",

Despite the huge gap in both user numbers and funding between the two, Threads seems to be borrowing from Bluesky's feature set to prevent it from becoming competitive.\n\nThe Verge reported that Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, announced that Threads’ algorithm is getting a “rebalancing” to “prioritize content from people you follow” and “less recommended content from accounts you don’t follow.” Which is pretty much how Bluesky does things.\n\n@mosseri/Threads\n\nThreads also started offering users a custom feeds tool as a way to stay way ahead of Bluesky’s sudden growth. (Custom feeds are a feature Bluesky has offered its users since May of 2023.) The feature lets users pin topics to their home feeds. It’s not known if the new algorithm change will affect the “For Your” custom feed.\n\nBluesky passed the 20 million user milestone on Tuesday. That number may still pale in comparison toThreads’ 275 million users but Mosseri’s announcement indicates Meta wants to remain the more enticing option for the estimated 550 million users still on X, should they eventually seek greener pastures.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-will-prioritize-accounts-you-follow-instead-of-randos-191529420.html?src=rss",

Transcripts are created on-device, are end-to-end encrypted, and aren't shared with WhatsApp.\n\nWhatsApp users can go to Settings > Chats > Voice Message Transcripts to turn transcriptions on and off and to select a preferred transcript language. A voice message can be transcribed by long pressing on it and tapping on the \"transcribe\" option.\n\nThe voice message transcript feature has been available to WhatsApp beta testers for months now, but it is now ready to start rolling out to all users. WhatsApp says that it will be coming to users worldwide \"over the coming weeks.\" A few select languages will be available at first, including English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Russian, but more will be added in the future.",

        "content": "Years into the escalating, multibillion-dollar global crisis of pig butchering scams, social media giant Meta released information for the first time on Thursday about its approach to combating the forced-labor compounds that fuel scam activity on its platforms and across the web.\n\nThe company says that for more than two years it has been focused on collaborating with global law enforcement and other tech companies to address the underlying problem of organized crime syndicates driving scam activity in Southeast Asia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMeta says that so far this year it has done takedowns of more than 2 million accounts connected to scam compounds in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, and the UAE. The company has also been collaborating with external experts, including tech companies, NGOs, and coalitions working to counter online scams. As pig butchering scams generate significant revenue for criminals, though, and spread around the world, Meta notes that it has focused on working with law enforcement to directly track criminal syndicates.\n\n“This is a highly adversarial space where we expect well-resourced and persistent criminal organizations to constantly evolve their tactics (both online and offline) in response to detection and enforcement to try and reconstitute across the internet,” a Meta spokesperson wrote in a statement. The company declined to share how many accounts it had removed prior to this year.\n\nLongtime pig butchering researchers say that Meta has been slow to publicly and directly acknowledge the problem and the role its many platforms play in connecting scammers with potential victims. They emphasize that Meta’s services are far from the only platforms that scammers use to reach victims. But platforms like Facebook and Instagram are recognizable and trusted around the world, so it is inevitable, the researchers say, that scammers will gravitate to them. And Meta has warned its users broadly about investment and romance scams.\n\n“I'm glad that Meta is finally starting to talk about this work, but in the research community, we feel like we've been trying to get their attention for a long time and collaborate with them and they often aren't engaging with us,” says Ronnie Tokazowski, a longtime pig butchering researcher and cofounder of the nonprofit Intelligence for Good.",
        "summary": "Meta has revealed its efforts to combat pig butchering scams, which involve forced-labor compounds and organized crime syndicates, particularly in Southeast Asia and the UAE. The company has collaborated with global law enforcement, tech companies, NGOs, and coalitions to address these scams, removing over 2 million accounts linked to scam operations this year. Despite these efforts, Meta acknowledges the challenge of dealing with well-resourced criminal organizations that continually adapt their tactics.

In an update, the company said it has taken down more than 2 million accounts associated with such scams this year and that its effort to work with other companies to take down fraudsters has had some success.\n\nDescribed by Meta as “one of the most egregious and sophisticated” online scams, pig butchering is an increasingly common ruse in which scammers trick victims, who they often find on social media and dating apps, into making crypto investments and other financial schemes before disappearing with their funds. One study, published earlier this year and reported by Bloomberg, found that these scams “have likely stolen more than $75 billion from victims around the world” since 2020.\n\nMeta says it’s been tracking the criminal networks behind these scams for the last two years as these groups have increasingly grown their geographic footprint. “This year alone, we’ve taken down over two million accounts associated with scam centers in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines,” the company said in a blog post. “We also continue to update behavioral and technical signals associated with these hubs to help us scale automated detection and block malicious infrastructure and recidivist attempts.”\n\nEarlier this year, Meta joined Match Group, Coinbase and others in forming a coalition to jointly fight financial scams. In its latest update, Meta notes that it has also worked with other firms exploited by scammers. It says that OpenAI recently tipped off the social media company to “a newly stood up scam compound in Cambodia” after the AI company caught the would-be scammers attempting to translate scam content.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-says-its-taken-down-2-million-accounts-linked-to-pig-butchering-scams-180036668.html?src=rss",

        "content": "Meta has shut down over 2 million accounts this year linked to \"pig butchering\" scams, which trick users into investing in dubious cryptocurrency schemes.\n\nThe accounts were sourced to \"forced-labor\" scam compounds, mainly in Southeast Asia, where organized criminals use thousands of workers to engage in deceptive schemes.\n\nAlthough the scam centers are based in countries like Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia, they target internet users worldwide. The goal is to build relationships with potential victims before \"slaughtering\" them like pigs by conning them into scam investments.\n\nOn Thursday, Meta said it spent the last two years investigating and disrupting scam centers in Southeast Asia and, more recently, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe scam centers sometimes force locals to work there using threats of physical violence. \"The scale and sophistication of this threat is unprecedented, with the US Institute of Peace estimating that up to 300,000 people are forced into scamming others around the world by these criminal groups, with about $64 billion dollars stolen worldwide annually as of the end of 2023,\" Meta says.\n\nWorkers will engage in a wide range of online scams that often involve impersonating people, from attractive singles to trusted government figures or businesses, and reaching out to victims through emails, text messages, social media, or chat apps.\n\n\"We assess that much of the scam centers’ activity is tightly scripted by criminal syndicates to scale their operations,\" Meta adds. \"It includes some forced-labor scammers focusing on casting a wide net online (often through automated means) to ‘spray and pray’ by reaching out to a large number of people via text message or online with a relatively generic appeal in hopes that some of them will respond. If they do, another group of scammers focuses on more tailored social engineering attempts to build trust and convince the potential targets to send money and invest.”\n\nThe investment schemes, which often involve cryptocurrency, usually let victims withdraw some funds initially. But eventually, the fraudsters lock up and steal the funds.\n\nThe details from Meta underscore the massive scale of today’s online scams and serve as a reminder to watch out for potential fraudsters, especially when talking with strangers. Since 2021, one in four people who reported losing money through fraud said it started on social media, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTo fight back, Facebook’s parent company has been working with local law enforcement and sharing intelligence with other companies, such as Coinbase and online dating provider Match Group, to shut down the malicious activity. Meta has also been rolling out safety features to warn users about suspected scams on its platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nAs an example, Meta said: \"On WhatsApp, if you’re added to a group chat by someone you don’t know, you’ll now see a context card giving you more information about the group. It’ll show who added you, how recently the group was created and who created it so you have context on this outreach.\"",

        "content": "Meta says it's taken down more than 2 million accounts this year linked to overseas criminal gangs behind scam operations that human rights activists say forced hundreds of thousands of people to work as scammers and cost victims worldwide billions of dollars.\n\nIn a Thursday blog post, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp says the pig butchering scam operations — based in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines — use platforms like Facebook and Instagram; dating, messaging, crypto and other kinds of apps; and texts and emails, to globally target people.\n\nIn these pig butchering schemes — as in fattening up a pig before you slaughter it — the scammers strike up an online relationship with their victims and gain their trust. Then they move their conversations to crypto apps or scam websites and dupe victims into making bogus investments or otherwise handing over their money, Meta said.\n\nThey'll ask the victims to deposit money, often in the form of cryptocurrency, into accounts, sometimes even letting the victims make small withdrawals, in order to add a veneer of legitimacy. But once the victim starts asking for their investment back, or it becomes clear they don't have any more money to deposit, the scammer disappears and takes the money with them.\n\nAnd the people doing the scamming are often victims themselves. During the COVID-19 pandemic, criminal gangs began building scam centers in Southeast Asia, luring in often unsuspecting job seekers with what looked like amazing postings on local job boards and other platforms, then forcing them to work as scammers, often under the threat of physical harm.\n\nThe scope of what's become a global problem is staggering. In a report issued in May, the US Institute of Peace estimates that at least 300,000 people are being forced to work, or are otherwise suffering human rights violations, inside these scam centers. The report also estimates global financial losses stemming from the scams at $64 billion in 2023, with the number of financial victims in the millions.\n\nMeta says it has focused on investigating and disrupting the scam operations for more than two years, working with nongovernmental organizations and other tech companies, like OpenAI, Coinbase and dating-app operator Match Group, along with law enforcement in both the US and the countries where the centers are located.\n\nIt's also trying to better educate its users, adding warnings to Messenger and Instagram DMs reminding people to be aware of potentially suspicious or unsolicited messages from people they don't know. And on WhatsApp, if users are added to a group chat by someone they don't know, they'll now see a context card that will show who added them, how recently the group was created and who created it.\n\nTips for avoiding pig butchering scams\n\nLock down your accounts. Always arm your social media accounts with two-factor authentication. That puts a second layer of protection in place that will help keep you safe if your password is stolen. Meta accounts also can be secured with \"selfie verification.\" If you get locked out of your account, you can snap a selfie to get back in faster.\n\nBe very skeptical of amazing deals. If someone you don't know reaches out to you through social media, another app, or by email or text with what sounds like an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true, it probably is. Don't take the bait.\n\nKnow who you're dealing with. Scammers often impersonate celebrities. They'll copy the account of a high-profile person you follow, then reach out pretending to be them. Romance scammers operate in much the same way. They might tell you you look cute, then build a fake online relationship before scamming you out of your money. Even if you feel like you know these \"people,\" you don't. Stay away.\n\nThat also goes for businesses. It's gotten a lot easier for scammers to impersonate popular companies through fake messages that can take you to scam websites that look very much like the real thing. If you get an email, text or message on social media from what looks like your favorite retailer offering a great deal on something you really want, delete it and just go to their real website directly.",
        "summary": "Meta has removed over 2 million accounts this year linked to international criminal gangs running scam operations that have coerced hundreds of thousands into working as scammers, resulting in billions of dollars in global losses.

        "content": "Meta has shut down over 2 million accounts this year linked to \"pig butchering\" scams, which trick users into investing in dubious cryptocurrency schemes.\n\nThe accounts were sourced to \"forced-labor\" scam compounds, mainly in Southeast Asia, where organized criminals use thousands of workers to engage in deceptive schemes.\n\nAlthough the scam centers are based in countries like Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia, they target internet users worldwide. The goal is to build relationships with potential victims before \"slaughtering\" them like pigs by conning them into scam investments.\n\nOn Thursday, Meta said it spent the last two years investigating and disrupting scam centers in Southeast Asia and, more recently, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe scam centers sometimes force locals to work there using threats of physical violence. \"The scale and sophistication of this threat is unprecedented, with the US Institute of Peace estimating that up to 300,000 people are forced into scamming others around the world by these criminal groups, with about $64 billion dollars stolen worldwide annually as of the end of 2023,\" Meta says.\n\nWorkers will engage in a wide range of online scams that often involve impersonating people, from attractive singles to trusted government figures or businesses, and reaching out to victims through emails, text messages, social media, or chat apps.\n\n\"We assess that much of the scam centers’ activity is tightly scripted by criminal syndicates to scale their operations,\" Meta adds. \"It includes some forced-labor scammers focusing on casting a wide net online (often through automated means) to ‘spray and pray’ by reaching out to a large number of people via text message or online with a relatively generic appeal in hopes that some of them will respond. If they do, another group of scammers focuses on more tailored social engineering attempts to build trust and convince the potential targets to send money and invest.”\n\nThe investment schemes, which often involve cryptocurrency, usually let victims withdraw some funds initially. But eventually, the fraudsters lock up and steal the funds.\n\nThe details from Meta underscore the massive scale of today’s online scams and serve as a reminder to watch out for potential fraudsters, especially when talking with strangers. Since 2021, one in four people who reported losing money through fraud said it started on social media, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTo fight back, Facebook’s parent company has been working with local law enforcement and sharing intelligence with other companies, such as Coinbase and online dating provider Match Group, to shut down the malicious activity. Meta has also been rolling out safety features to warn users about suspected scams on its platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nAs an example, Meta said: \"On WhatsApp, if you’re added to a group chat by someone you don’t know, you’ll now see a context card giving you more information about the group. It’ll show who added you, how recently the group was created and who created it so you have context on this outreach.\"",

Soon, people in France, Italy, Ireland, and Spain will be able to buy the AI-powered wearables, and the Meta AI assistant will be able to communicate with users in Spanish, French, Italian, and English.\n\n\"With Meta AI on Ray-Ban Meta glasses, people have a hands-free way to ask questions on-the-go and receive real time answers and information, recommendations, or even receive some creative writing inspiration,\" Meta described in a blog post. \"For example, you can ask, “Hey Meta, what’s the best patisserie in Paris?” or “What are some good gift ideas for my kids aged 6 and 8?” and receive an answer instantly. \"\n\nEuropean locales won't have access to all the features of the smart glasses available in the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Specifically, European wearers won't be able to ask Meta AI about what's around them and hear a description of landmarks or events around them, at least for now.\n\nIn the U.S., you might look at the Statue of Liberty and ask about its history or ask the AI to tell you the species of a plant you see on a hike.\n\nAI EU\n\nThat might be a regulatory issue about the smart glasses and their visual processing ability rather than a technical obstacle. This isn't the first time Meta has cited the EU's regulatory environment as a barrier to its feature rollouts.\n\nSimilar rules slowed the release of the Meta AI assistant across the continent. As the tech giant continues to work with government agencies, more European countries will likely get access to the smart glasses.\n\nStill, four new countries and three new languages are a big deal. They extend the potential market enormously, particularly in regions where English is uncommon. Plus, there are an enormous number of countries where Spanish and French are spoken, albeit in many different dialects.\n\nGet the best Black Friday deals direct to your inbox, plus news, reviews, and more.

You’ll also find options to adjust noise cancellation or switch your call’s audio output. Meta says it’s giving users the ability to leave voice or video messages as well.\n\nMessenger now has AI-generated backgrounds. Image: Meta\n\nRelated Meta is ending support for custom face filters in its apps\n\nApps like Google Meet, Zoom, and FaceTime have all had these features already, and for many years in some cases. The same goes for AI-generated backgrounds, at least for Zoom and Meet. To try them inside Messenger, tap the effects icon in a call’s sidebar, describe what you want in a prompt box, and Meta AI will generate a background for you. Meta has been rolling out AI image generation elsewhere, including in Messenger chats and on Facebook and Instagram.",

Messenger will also support HD video calls, in addition to background noise suppression and voice isolation for better-looking (and better-sounding) video calls.\n\nREAD: Meta AI for WhatsApp could soon offer more personalized experiences\n\nHD will be enabled by default for video calls over WiFi, although users will need to toggle “Mobile data for HD video” in order to use HD quality for mobile data. Meanwhile, Background noise suppression and voice isolation can be enabled via call settings in the Messenger app.\n\nThe app will also allow users to save recorded messages for unanswered audio calls, or video for unanswered video calls. For iPhone users, Siri will be able to follow voice commands in order to send messages. For example, a user can prompt the voice assistant with “Hey Siri, send a message to Cassandra on Messenger” and then dictate their respective message.\n\nSource: Meta",

A few months later, Meta is finally rolling out Custom Feeds globally to all users of the Threads app.\n\nThreads app now has Custom Feeds\n\nAs confirmed by Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, the option to create Custom Feeds in the Threads app is now available to everyone around the world. The feature works in much the same way as the option to create columns based on search results on the desktop. However, on the mobile app, users need to pull down on the Threads homepage to see all their feeds.\n\nTo create a new feed, all you need to do is search for a topic in the Threads app and tap the three-dot menu. Threads will then show you the options of creating a new feed based on that search result or adding that keyword to an existing feed.\n\nAlso with the update, Threads is making it easier for users to choose between seeing search results based on suggested posts, most recent posts, or user profiles.\n\nMore recently, Meta announced that it will start showing ads to users on Threads next year. The move is a result of the platform’s significant growth since it was launched – Threads now has over 200 million monthly active users.\n\nThe Threads app is available for free on the App Store and requires an iPhone running iOS 15.1 or later. Make sure you update the app to the latest version in order to get access to the new features.\n\nRead also",

The Facebook calling service is also adding AI video backgrounds and integrating Siri.\n\nApple introduced the highly requested FaceTime video message feature last year, and Meta is joining the party with Messenger today. Voicemail for unanswered calls is actually new for both video and audio calls.\n\nOne feature still missing from both FaceTime and Messenger is custom answering machine-style messages for when you’re unavailable. Other telephony features include voice isolation and background noise suppression.\n\nMessenger is also integrating with Siri in a big way. Meta explains:\n\nWhen your hands are full or your phone is out of reach, you can now ask Siri to help you make your calls and messages wherever you are. Try something like: “Hey Siri, send a message to Cassandra on Messenger” and then dictate what that message will be.\n\nPretty rad if you’re a frequent Messenger caller.\n\nAnd it wouldn’t be a service update without a hint of AI baked in, right? Meta is turning on the ability to create AI-generated backgrounds that can be used during video calls. While FaceTime recently added custom backgrounds, we’ll have to wait for Apple Intelligence and Image Playground integration.\n\nRead more about the latest version of Messenger here.",

With custom feeds, you can track topics and accounts in one feed, making it easier to keep an eye on specific things that matter to you.\n\nTo make a custom feed, search for a topic, then click on the three dots menu next to the search bar, and then click on the “Create new feed” option. Custom feeds can also contain information about multiple topics — just add a new one from a search or, on desktop, from the three dots menu next to a feed. You can add individual accounts to custom feeds, too, giving you a lot of flexibility on what’s contained in that feed.\n\nThe quick rollout of the feature follows increased pressure from Bluesky, which has skyrocketed in popularity as of late. (And also has custom feeds.) Yesterday, the platform crossed 20 million users, and Bluesky CEO Jay Graber said that the platform has added more than a million users per day “for the last few days.” The platform was at 15 million users as of November 13th.",

        "content": "As X competitor Bluesky takes off, topping 20 million users, Meta’s own Twitter-like app, Instagram Threads, has begun rolling out a new feature called custom feeds to its global audience. Hoping to capitalize on user demand for more personalization, custom feeds are meant to allow Threads users to easily build feeds around specific topics or those including certain user profiles.\n\nThis would make it easier for Threads users to tap into the communities and conversations that are most important to them and could help to challenge Bluesky’s own set of tools for personalization, including those that let users build their own algorithms, feeds, and lists, as well as those that let them configure their own moderation tools.\n\nThe global launch of custom feeds on Threads comes only days after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the feature was entering testing. That signals that Threads is moving quickly to topple some of the momentum that Bluesky has recently seen. Since the U.S. elections, Bluesky adoption has soared as users looked for an alternative to the now more right-leaning X, owned by Elon Musk. Other decisions at X have also pushed people to depart, including how it has changed the block feature and its policy around training AI models on user data.\n\nAs a result, Bluesky has significantly grown its user base from around 7 million users just a couple of months ago to now north of 20 million.\n\nBut Threads retains the lead among the X competitors, with more than 275 million monthly users, largely thanks to its ability to jump-start its network by leveraging Instagram’s social graph and integrations with Meta’s other apps. However, some users on Threads have been disappointed by its decision to deprioritize politics, and have asked for other options beyond the default algorithmic “For You” feed and the chronological “Following” feed.\n\nThat’s where custom feeds come in.\n\nTo use the feature, you’ll first need to search for and then tap into a topic to see the latest posts. From there, you’ll tap on the three-dot icon next to the search term and choose the option “create new feed.” You can also choose to add specific user profiles to a feed by visiting the user’s profile, tapping the three-dot icon above their profile photo, and then tapping to add them to one of your feeds.\n\nAfter the feeds are created, they can be pinned to the top of the Threads’ home screen on the web in the columns-based view (similar to Twitter’s TweetDeck or X Pro), making them easier to access.",
        "summary": "Meta's Instagram Threads is introducing a new feature called custom feeds to enhance user personalization, allowing users to create feeds based on specific topics or user profiles. This feature aims to help Threads users engage more deeply with communities and conversations that matter to them, potentially challenging Bluesky's personalization tools. The rollout of custom feeds follows Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's announcement of the feature entering testing, indicating Threads' quick response to Bluesky's growing popularity. Bluesky has seen a significant increase in users, reaching over 20 million, partly due to dissatisfaction with changes at X, formerly Twitter. Despite Bluesky's growth, Threads remains the leader among X competitors with over 275 million monthly users, leveraging Instagram's social graph and Meta's app integrations, though some users desire more options beyond the default feeds.",

        "content": "(he/him) is a guides editor at Polygon, where he writes, edits, and shepherds service-oriented articles about the biggest games du jour. He previously worked at Kotaku.\n\nThe Pokémon TCG Pocket meta has become clear, now that the mobile card game has officially drained the battery life of every smartphone this side of Kanto.\n\nReleased in late October 2024, Pokémon TCG Pocket is primarily a card-collecting game, though there is a competitive element — a streamlined iteration on the classic Pokémon trading card game. There’s incentive to play battles, too, as winning earns you XP, which helps you level up, which helps you open more booster packs, which helps you build better decks to win more battles. Ah, the great mobile game feedback loop.\n\nWhat follows is a summary of the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta as of November 2024, including the best decks and the best cards. We’ll update this guide as the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta meaningfully shifts.\n\nWhat is the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta right now?\n\nGraphic: Polygon | Source images: Creatures, DeNA/The Pokémon Company\n\nAt present, all available cards in Pokémon TCG Pocket are from the Genetic Apex expansion, which features three types of booster pack: Mewtwo ex, Pikachu ex, and Charizard ex. No huge surprise, but the three headline cards have come to define the meta since the game’s release.\n\nDecks in Pokémon TCG Pocket comprise 20 cards each. Though you can mix and match types when building a deck, the viable decks du jour are designed around one element. Since most attacks are powered by a specific elemental type, you don’t want to leave the element you draw each turn up to a coin flip. Pokémon TCG Pocket has enough coin flips already.\n\nFurthermore, the best decks are for the most part built around one or two specific cards, with the rest of the deck padded out by trainer cards (items or supporters) and basic Pokémon of the same elemental type. As of November 2024, those top decks are:\n\nMewtwo ex and Gardevoir (psychic-type)\n\nPikachu ex (electric-type)\n\nCharizard ex and Moltres ex (fire-type)\n\nArticuno ex and Lapras ex (water-type)\n\nIn other words, smash that “concede” button if you see any of the above cards on your opponent’s side — and we get into more detail about why these decks are so successful below.\n\nPokémon TCG Pocket best decks\n\nKnowing the best cards of the moment is one thing, but getting those cards is another matter. Right now, the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta is defined by ex cards — high-power cards that are also extremely rare.\n\nYou can get these from booster packs (you can see your chances of specific cards by clicking the “offering rates” button on the lower-left corner), but if you’re struggling, know you can get specific cards by exchanging pack points, a currency you’ll earn by opening booster packs.\n\nEx cards start at 500 pack points, though, and currently, you only get five pack points for every booster pack you open. So even if you’re willing to spend IRL money on Poké Gold to open a bunch of packs, you’ll still have to sit through a lot of mindless clicking before you can afford the exact ex card of your choice.\n\nIn other words, until trading is introduced in January 2025, the best way to get any of the following cards is… Luck.\n\nMewtwo ex and Gardevoir deck\n\nGraphic: Polygon | Source images: DeNA, Creatures/The Pokémon Company\n\nMewtwo ex is dominating the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta at the moment, thanks to its Psydrive attack, which deals 150 damage. Few Pokémon have 150 HP to survive such a hit, but the attack costs Mewtwo ex four energy to use and further discards two psychic-type energy with each use.\n\nThe trick here is to lean on Gardevoir. Gardevoir’s ability, Psy Shadow, allows you to add an extra energy to whatever Pokémon you have in the active spot — and you can use it even with Gardevoir on your bench. This combo allows you to recoup the two energy you burn with each use of Psydrive (one from your turn naturally and one Gardevoir’s ability), essentially guaranteeing 150-damage attacks with no drawbacks.\n\nPikachu ex deck\n\nPikachu ex might as well be Ash Ketchum’s uncannily super-powered Pikachu. Pikachu ex isn’t part of an evolution chair, so if you draw it, you’re ready to play it. Its attack, Circle Circuit, also only costs two electric energy and deals 30 damage for every electric-type Pokémon on your bench. Stack all three slots on your bench with electric-type Pokémon, and you’re dealing 90 damage per turn.\n\nElectric-type cards in general tend to have lower retreat costs (Electrode has a free retreat, for instance), allowing you to easily swap out cards as needed, keeping your bench — and Pikachu ex’s attack power — at full capacity. This deck also works well with Zapdos ex or Jolteon as backup attackers; both have attacks that can deal up to 200 or 160 damage respectively.\n\nCharizard ex and Moltres ex deck\n\nThe Charizard ex deck functions a lot like the Mewtwo ex deck in that you have to use one Pokémon to generate energy for another. The key here is to open with Moltres ex. With its Inferno Dance attack, you flip three coins, and for every heads you get, you can apply one bonus fire energy to a Pokémon on your bench. You can load up a Charmander or Charmeleon with with up to three energy per turn.\n\nWhen your Charmeleon is ready to evolve into Charizard ex, it’ll hopefully have enough energy to use Charizard ex’s Crimson Storm attack, which costs four energy and deals 200 damage but also discards two energy per use. Pull off this combo correctly, and your Charizard ex card should have enough energy to persistently use Crimson Storm. Charizard ex also has 180 HP — enough to survive a hit from Mewtwo ex’s meta-dominating Psydrive attack.\n\nLapras ex and Articuno ex deck\n\nLapras ex was introduced via Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first battle event, and goes hand-in-hand with Articuno ex. Both cards are basic-stage, so you can play them immediately, and both cards have powerful attacks. Articuno ex’s Blizzard attack deals 80 damage to your opponent’s active Pokémon and 10 damage to any cards on their bench, so you can conceivably knock out any weakened Pokémon on your opponent’s back row. Lapras ex’s attack, Bubble Drain, deals 80 damage to your opponent but heals 20 HP to itself.\n\nBoth cards are powerful in a vacuum, but to make the most of this deck, you’ll want to use a Misty trainer card. When you play Misty, you flip a coin repeatedly until you get tails. For however many heads you get, you can attach that amount of water energy to one of your Pokémon. If luck is on your side, you can fully power up Lapras ex or Articuno ex in one turn.\n\nStarmie ex, with its 90-damage attack and free retreat, is another good card to run in this deck.\n\nBest cards to include in any meta deck\n\nGraphic: Polygon | Source images: DeNA, Creatures/The Pokémon Company\n\nFinally, every meta-viable deck right now features at least one copy of each of the following trainer cards:\n\nRed Card\n\nSabrina\n\nX Speed\n\nProfessor Oak\n\nProfessor Oak lets you draw two cards, capitalizing on the universal card game theory that suggests, the more cards you draw, the better your chances of victory. Red Card is the opposite: It shuffles your opponent’s hand back into their deck, and then they draw three cards. (It’s best deployed to mess with your opponent after they play a Professor Oak or Poké Ball card, both of which add cards to their hand.)",

        "content": "A federal judge in Delaware on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee against social media giant Meta over advertisements using his name and image to sell CBD products.\n\nHuckabee, a Baptist minister and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Israel, claimed Meta allowed and profited from the advertisements that falsely claimed he used and endorsed CBD gummies. CBD, or cannabidiol, is one the main active ingredients in marijuana but does not, by itself, provide the high caused by psychoactive THC.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, argued that it was immune from liability under Section 230 of the Federal Communication Decency Act.\n\nU.S. District Judge Gregory Williams rejected that claim. He concluded, however, that Huckabee, a political commentator and two-time presidential candidate, had failed to allege valid claims for invasion of privacy, unjust enrichment and violation of Arkansas’ Publicity Protection Act.\n\nWilliams agreed with Huckabee that, in collecting user data and using algorithms to determine which posts and advertisements appeared at the top of users’ newsfeeds, Meta was an “information content provider” that was not immune from liability for the illegitimate ads.\n\nThe judge nevertheless determined that Huckabee failed to demonstrate that Meta knew the ads were fake, or that it was at least aware of facts and circumstances that would give rise to such knowledge. Huckabee’s assertion that Meta approved and maintained the ads with actual malice or reckless disregard for their truthfulness was merely a “mere conclusory statement,” Williams wrote.\n\n“It is not reasonable to infer that Meta entertained serious doubts about the asserted advertisements since Governor Huckabee has publicly denounced marijuana,” the judge wrote. “There is no allegation that Meta was required to conduct ‘due diligence’ on the truth of the asserted advertisements. Even if there was, such requirement would be insufficient to infer malice.”\n\nCopyright 2024 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "content": "Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nIf you've been itching for a mixed-reality version of Windows, your time is here.\n\nAt its 2024 Ignite event this week, Microsoft announced it's bringing \"full capabilities of Windows 11\" to mixed reality headsets, starting with the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S.\n\nAlso: The end of ChromeOS is a new dawn for cheap Android laptops\n\nThis feature allows you to access your local Windows PC or Windows 365 Cloud PC from a Quest headset. It only takes a few seconds to connect, Microsoft says, and get a private, high-quality, multiple-monitor workstation with huge screens.\n\nThis doesn't mean that you'll be able to run Windows on your Quest, but you will be able to stream your PC or virtual cloud PC to your headset.\n\nWatch Microsoft's short video about the new feature below.\n\nThe ability to take a computer screen to a VR headset was previously one of the biggest differences between Meta's headset and Apple's Vision Pro. At Meta Connect 2024, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that all you need to do to connect your Quest headsets to Windows 11 PCs is \"just look at the keyboard.\" He didn't elaborate on whether we would see Vision Pro-style gesture controls.\n\nAlso: Amazon just launched a huge Echo Show 21 and a brand new Echo Show 15\n\nCasting is already available to a degree in the Meta Horizon Workroom app, with Meta's Air Link, or through a third-party app, but now you don't need any new software or apps.\n\nDetails are pretty sparse, but Microsoft did say that the feature would arrive in December as part of a public preview. Given Microsoft's wording of \"starting\" with the Quest 3 and 3S, it seems likely that support for other headsets is on the way.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft teased a further collaboration with Meta, saying that it was working on \"Windows Volumetric Apps\" for Meta Quest headsets that extend flat screens into a 3D space. It didn't reveal exactly which apps would be compatible.",

        "content": "The Framingham Centre Common is dotted with historical buildings, including the one that houses the Danforth Art Museum. Although not as large or renowned as other art museums near the Boston area, the Danforth has something in their collection no other museum has; the largest collection of works by Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller who was one of the first Black American female sculptors and the first artist to be commissioned by the U.S. government to do a series of dioramas on African-American history.\n\nMeta Vaux Warrick Fuller was born in Philadelphia in 1877 to a middle-class family. Her mother was a beautician and her father was a barber. During the Reconstruction era, many formerly enslaved people moved north, and Philadelphia became home to a vibrant Black community. Her parents were able to find success with their creative talents and Warrick was educated in art, music, dance, and horseback riding.\n\nWarrick’s artistic career began when one of her high school projects was chosen to be displayed at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Afterward, she was given a scholarship at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, where she rejected more traditional feminine artistic themes to focus on chronicling the Black experience in the United States. After graduating in 1899, she traveled to Paris, where she studied under the tutelage of Raphaël Collin at the Académie Colarossi and the École des Beaux-Arts. Due to racial discrimination, the American Woman’s Club of Paris refused to give her lodging, though she had made reservations beforehand. Thankfully, another prominent Black American artist and family friend, Henry Ossawa Tanner, provided her with lodging and introduced her to his friends.\n\nWarrick continued to hone her skills as a sculptor. She was deeply influenced by Auguste Rodin, and became his protégé in 1902. Her sculptures were displayed at galleries in Paris, drawing in crowds who praised her works. While in Paris, Warrick also met W.E.B. Du Bois, who became a lifelong confidant and friend. He encouraged her to draw inspiration from African and Black American themes in her work.\n\nWhen Warrick returned to Philadelphia, much of her work was shunned by the upper-class members of the city. They saw her sculptures as grotesque, foreign, and unappealing. But her work depicting the suffering of Black subjects resonated strongly within the African-American community. Warrick became the first African-American woman to receive a U.S. government commission. For the Jamestown Tercentennial Exposition of 1907, she created sculptures regarding slavery, African-American life during the colonial era, and the impact of the Civil War.\n\nIn 1909, she married Dr. Solomon Carter Fuller, an immigrant from Liberia and one of the first Black psychiatrists in the United States. They settled in Framingham, Massachusetts, becoming one of the first Black families in the community.\n\nFuller remained active in the artistic community. In 1910, a fire in a Philadelphia warehouse resulted in the loss of about 16 years’ worth of her work. As a result, she built a studio in the attic of her home where she created art throughout the rest of her career. Fuller continued to use her art to address racial injustices in American society such as her sculpture dedicated to Mary Turner, a young, pregnant Black woman who was lynched alongside a dozen others in May 1918. Fuller also actively participated in the women’s suffrage movement but felt alienated and left soon after once it became evident Black women were not included in the vision of many of her fellow suffragists.\n\nFuller became an active member of the Harlem Renaissance Movement. In 1921, she exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts for the America’s Making Exposition which was intended to highlight immigrant contributions to American art. She created a series of sculptures titled Ethiopia, which depicted an African woman emerging from mummy wrappings like a chrysalis from a cocoon, symbolizing Black femininity and identity.\n\nIn addition to sculpture, Fuller also made significant contributions to painting, theater, and poetry. On the stage, she was a multi-faceted designer, director, and actress. She became involved in various African-American theatre and drama groups around the Boston area and joined the Allied Arts Theatre Group. She wrote about six plays under the pseudonym Danny Deaver.\n\nAfter her death in March 1968, many of Fuller’s accomplishments and contributions fell into obscurity, but they have received renewed attention since the turn of the 21st century. Her work can be found across the U.S., but the Danforth Art Museum has the largest collection, as well as a replica of her home studio and unfinished pieces.\n\nMeta Vaux Warrick Fuller dedicated her life to pioneering both women and Black art in a time when both were heavily stigmatized by much of society. Her legacy is that of innovation, imagination, resilience, and fortitude, and her life story is certain to inspire so many others for generations to come.",
