This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., it may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability may result in file disclosure.\n\n\n\nOracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible.\n\nAffected Products and Patch Information\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities addressed by this Security Alert affect the products listed below.\n\nPlease click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.\n\nSecurity Alert Supported Products and Versions\n\nPatches released through the Security Alert program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the Lifetime Support Policy. Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Security Alert program are available for the versions they are currently running.\n\nProduct releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Security Alert. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.\n\nReferences\n\nRisk Matrix Content\n\nRisk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts. An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is here.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see Oracle CVSS Scoring for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).\n\nOracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Security Alert. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about conditions required to exploit the vulnerability and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.\n\nThe protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected.\n\nCredit Statement\n\nThe following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Security Alert to Oracle:\n\nJoel Snape of CrowdStrike: CVE-2024-21287\n\nLutz Wolf of CrowdStrike: CVE-2024-21287\n\nModification History\n\nDate Note 2024-November-18 Rev 1. Initial Release.\n\nOracle Supply Chain Risk Matrix\n\nThis Security Alert contains 1 new security patch for Oracle Supply Chain.

        "content": "SQL Formatter Pre-Commit Hook\n\nThis repository includes a pre-configured pre-commit hook to automatically format SQL and PL/SQL files before each commit, ensuring consistent code style across the project. It leverages Trivadis' advanced format settings for alignment, spacing, and other formatting standards.\n\nFeatures\n\nAutomatic Formatting : Formats SQL files with specified extensions to maintain code consistency.\n\n: Formats SQL files with specified extensions to maintain code consistency. Supported File Types : Includes common SQL and PL/SQL file extensions such as .sql , .prc , .fnc , .pks , .pkb , .trg , .pls , and more.\n\n: Includes common SQL and PL/SQL file extensions such as , , , , , , , and more. Configurable Settings : Uses trivadis_advanced_format.xml for advanced formatting configurations, which can be customized as needed.\n\n: Uses for advanced formatting configurations, which can be customized as needed. Flexible SQLcl Path: Allows specifying the SQLcl path using the SQL_PROGRAM environment variable.\n\nRequirements\n\nSQLcl\n\nThis pre-commit hook requires Oracle SQLcl (SQL Command Line) to perform SQL formatting. SQLcl provides powerful SQL scripting and formatting capabilities. Follow these steps to download and install it:\n\nDownload SQLcl : The latest version can be downloaded from Oracle SQLcl Downloads.\n\n: The latest version can be downloaded from Oracle SQLcl Downloads. Install SQLcl: Refer to the installation guide if needed.\n\nOptional: Set SQLcl Path\n\nIf SQLcl is not in your system PATH or if you want to specify a custom path, set the SQL_PROGRAM environment variable to the path of the sql binary. For example:\n\nexport SQL_PROGRAM = \"/path/to/sqlcl/bin/sql\"\n\nGit\n\nEnsure Git is installed as this pre-commit hook uses Git’s pre-commit hook system.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo use this hook with pre-commit , add it to your .pre-commit-config.yaml file in the target repository. Here’s an example configuration:\n\n# .pre-commit-config.yaml repos : - repo : https://github.com/GentleGhostCoder/oracle-formatter-pre-commit-hook # Replace with your GitHub repo URL rev : v1.0.0 # Use a tag, branch name, or commit SHA hooks : - id : oracle-formatter-hook\n\nThen, install the hook by running:\n\npre-commit install\n\nThis command sets up the pre-commit hook to run automatically before each commit.\n\nHow It Works\n\nIdentify Relevant Files: The hook detects files based on specified extensions. Format Files: Each identified file is formatted using formatter/format.js via SQLcl, applying the settings in trivadis_advanced_format.xml .\n\nUsage\n\nStage SQL Files: Stage files for commit using git add . Commit Changes: Commit staged files with git commit . The pre-commit hook will automatically format applicable files.\n\nRunning Manually with --all-files\n\nTo format all files, not just staged files, you can run the pre-commit hook manually:\n\npre-commit run --all-files\n\nThis triggers the formatting of all files matching the specified extensions in the repository.\n\nManual Formatting with the Python Entry Point\n\nTo manually format files without running the pre-commit hook, use the orafmt command directly if your module is installed:\n\norafmt file1.sql file2.sql\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Python script directly:\n\npython3 -m orafmt file1.sql file2.sql\n\nThis command will format the specified files according to the configurations.\n\nAdvanced Configuration\n\nTo modify formatting settings, edit the trivadis_advanced_format.xml file. These options allow customization of alignment, line breaks, and spacing based on project needs.\n\nLicense\n\nThis formatter uses Trivadis PL/SQL Formatter, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\nThe pre-commit hook itself is also available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.",

        "content": "Baby boomers own more homes than millennials and Gen Zers, creating a “generational schism” in the world of housing, according to Meredith Whitney, the “Oracle of Wall Street,” who predicted the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nBoomers aren’t selling, and that’s a problem. “They’re not selling because they’re aging in place, because they can’t afford to go anywhere else,” Whitney said last week in an interview with CNBC. “Until they sell, you’re going to have this real standoff between sellers and buyers.”\n\nSo what’ll it take? Well, home prices have to fall; Whitney said prices need to drop about 20%. But that price decline would only take us to the price levels of three or four years ago before the pandemic and its corresponding housing boom. Plus, people would still have a lot of equity in their homes, Whitney explained, so it wouldn’t be a housing crash.\n\nAt this point, it doesn’t make sense for a lot of people to sell their homes because they have either locked in a low mortgage rate or own their home outright. To give that up would likely mean a much higher mortgage rate, and a much more expensive home. Considering an unwillingness to sell from older generations, that leaves fewer homes for younger generations to buy; those that are for sale are, in some cases, unaffordable because prices continue to rise since supply is tight—and mortgage rates are higher than what people are used to.\n\nIn some cases, people list their homes at exorbitant prices and sell if they get an offer, or stay if it doesn’t meet their expectation, Whitney said. Sales are depressed, particularly at the middle and lower tiers of the market, whereas luxury is sort of carried by all-cash offers, she added. “Something has got to give in the regular market,” Whitney said. “I think you’re going to start to see home prices go down.”\n\n“For homes to be affordable, that’s going to have to happen,” she added. Whitney said she wrote a letter to whoever won the presidential election, telling them they have to let home prices drop, and it wouldn’t be the end of the world, for one, because “demand may be overstated.” (She didn’t provide any other details on the letter.)\n\nIn an interview with Fortune earlier this year, Whitney said she sees home prices falling 30% partly because young, single men are living at home, playing video games.\n\n“Unless you’re creating a household, there’s no reason to buy a house,” she told me at the time.\n\nThat’s just one part of her prediction. The other phenomenon that could lower home prices is the so-called silver tsunami, which refers to baby boomers and the supposed millions of homes that’ll flood the market in the next decade as they age and downsize and their homeownership rates decline. The two together would mean more supply, less demand, and falling prices, Whitney said. But it wouldn’t be a housing crash, in her mind. Instead, it’d be almost a reversal of the soaring prices fueled by the pandemic and once ultralow mortgage rates, she argues.\n\n\n\nBut here’s the thing: Home prices almost never go down. And in our current housing cycle, a shortfall of homes, to the tune of millions, is fueling that trend. If the situation were to reverse itself as Whitney has predicted (through supply that outweighs demand), it could be plausible that home prices could fall. But others in the industry have dismissed the silver tsunami phenomenon, suggesting the incoming supply, freed up by baby boomers wouldn’t be overwhelming and would be offset by younger generations who want and need homes.",

        "summary": "Meredith Whitney, known as the \"Oracle of Wall Street,\" highlights a generational divide in homeownership, with baby boomers owning more homes than millennials and Gen Z, and not selling due to affordability issues elsewhere. She suggests that home prices need to fall by about 20% to make homes more affordable, but this would not lead to a housing crash as people would still retain significant equity. Many homeowners are reluctant to sell because they have low mortgage rates or own their homes outright, leading to fewer homes available for younger buyers and contributing to rising prices. Whitney predicts that a combination of falling demand from young people not forming households and an eventual increase in supply from aging baby boomers could lead to a decrease in home prices. However, some industry experts doubt this \"silver tsunami\" will significantly impact the market, as the demand from younger generations may offset the increased supply.",

        "content": "Today, we’re announcing the availability, in preview, of a new capability in Amazon Data Firehose that captures changes made in databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL and replicates the updates to Apache Iceberg tables on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\n\nApache Iceberg is a high-performance open-source table format for performing big data analytics. Apache Iceberg brings the reliability and simplicity of SQL tables to S3 data lakes and makes it possible for open source analytics engines such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Trino, Apache Hive, and Apache Impala to concurrently work with the same data.\n\nThis new capability provides a simple, end-to-end solution to stream database updates without impacting transaction performance of database applications. You can set up a Data Firehose stream in minutes to deliver change data capture (CDC) updates from your database. Now, you can easily replicate data from different databases into Iceberg tables on Amazon S3 and use up-to-date data for large-scale analytics and machine learning (ML) applications.\n\nTypical Amazon Web Services (AWS) enterprise customers use hundreds of databases for transactional applications. To perform large scale analytics and ML on the latest data, they want to capture changes made in databases, such as when records in a table are inserted, modified, or deleted, and deliver the updates to their data warehouse or Amazon S3 data lake in open source table formats such as Apache Iceberg.\n\nTo do so, many customers develop extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs to periodically read from databases. However, ETL readers impact database transaction performance, and batch jobs can add several hours of delay before data is available for analytics. To mitigate impact on database transaction performance, customers want the ability to stream changes made in the database. This stream is referred to as a change data capture (CDC) stream.\n\nI met multiple customers that use open source distributed systems, such as Debezium, with connectors to popular databases, an Apache Kafka Connect cluster, and Kafka Connect Sink to read the events and deliver them to the destination. The initial configuration and test of such systems involves installing and configuring multiple open source components. It might take days or weeks. After setup, engineers have to monitor and manage clusters, and validate and apply open source updates, which adds to the operational overhead.\n\nWith this new data streaming capability, Amazon Data Firehose adds the ability to acquire and continually replicate CDC streams from databases to Apache Iceberg tables on Amazon S3. You set up a Data Firehose stream by specifying the source and destination. Data Firehose captures and continually replicates an initial data snapshot and then all subsequent changes made to the selected database tables as a data stream. To acquire CDC streams, Data Firehose uses the database replication log, which reduces impact on database transaction performance. When the volume of database updates increases or decreases, Data Firehose automatically partitions the data, and persists records until they’re delivered to the destination. You don’t have to provision capacity or manage and fine-tune clusters. In addition to the data itself, Data Firehose can automatically create Apache Iceberg tables using the same schema as the database tables as part of the initial Data Firehose stream creation and automatically evolve the target schema, such as new column addition, based on source schema changes.\n\nSince Data Firehose is a fully managed service, you don’t have to rely on open source components, apply software updates, or incur operational overhead.\n\nThe continual replication of database changes to Apache Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 using Amazon Data Firehose provides you with a simple, scalable, end-to-end managed solution to deliver CDC streams into your data lake or data warehouse, where you can run large-scale analysis and ML applications.\n\nLet’s see how to configure a new pipeline\n\nTo show you how to create a new CDC pipeline, I setup a Data Firehose stream using the AWS Management Console. As usual, I also have the choice to use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, AWS CloudFormation, or Terraform.\n\nFor this demo, I choose a MySQL database on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) as source. Data Firehose also works with self-managed databases on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). To establish connectivity between my virtual private cloud (VPC)—where the database is deployed—and the RDS API without exposing the traffic to the internet, I create an AWS PrivateLink VPC service endpoint. You can learn how to create a VPC service endpoint for RDS API by following instructions in the Amazon RDS documentation.\n\nI also have an S3 bucket to host the Iceberg table, and I have an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role setup with correct permissions. You can refer to the list of prerequisites in the Data Firehose documentation.\n\nTo get started, I open the console and navigate to the Amazon Data Firehose section. I can see the stream already created. To create a new one, I select Create Firehose stream.\n\nI select a Source and Destination. In this example: a MySQL database and Apache Iceberg Tables. I also enter a Firehose stream name for my stream.\n\nI enter the fully qualified DNS name of my Database endpoint and the Database VPC endpoint service name. I verify that Enable SSL is checked and, under Secret name, I select the name of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager where the database username and password are securely stored.\n\nNext, I configure Data Firehose to capture specific data by specifying databases, tables, and columns using explicit names or regular expressions.\n\nI must create a watermark table. A watermark, in this context, is a marker used by Data Firehose to track the progress of incremental snapshots of database tables. It helps Data Firehose identify which parts of the table have already been captured and which parts still need to be processed. I can create the watermark table manually or let Data Firehose automatically create it for me. In that case, the database credentials passed to Data Firehose must have permissions to create a table in the source database.\n\nNext, I configure the S3 bucket Region and name to use. Data Firehose can automatically create the Iceberg tables when they don’t exist yet. Similarly, it can update the Iceberg table schema when detecting a change in your database schema.\n\nAs a final step, it’s important to enable Amazon CloudWatch error logging to get feedback about the stream progress and the eventual errors. You can configure a short retention period on the CloudWatch log group to reduce the cost of log storage.\n\nAfter having reviewed my configuration, I select Create Firehose stream.\n\nOnce the stream is created, it will start to replicate the data. I can monitor the stream’s status and check for eventual errors.\n\nNow, it’s time to test the stream.\n\nI open a connection to the database and insert a new line in a table.\n\nThen, I navigate to the S3 bucket configured as the destination and I observe that a file has been created to store the data from the table.\n\nI download the file and inspect its content with the parq command (you can install that command with pip install parquet-cli )\n\nOf course, downloading and inspecting Parquet files is something I do only for demos. In real life, you’re going to use AWS Glue and Amazon Athena to manage your data catalog and to run SQL queries on your data.\n\nThings to know\n\nHere are a few additional things to know.\n\nThis new capability supports self-managed PostgreSQL and MySQL databases on Amazon EC2 and the following databases on Amazon RDS:\n\nThe team will continue to add support for additional databases during the preview period and after general availability. They told me they are already working on supporting SQL Server, Oracle, and MongoDB databases.\n\nData Firehose uses AWS PrivateLink to connect to databases in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).\n\nWhen setting up an Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream, you can either specify specific tables and columns or use wildcards to specify a class of tables and columns. When you use wildcards, if new tables and columns are added to the database after the Data Firehose stream is created and if they match the wildcard, Data Firehose will automatically create those tables and columns in the destination.\n\nPricing and availability\n\nThe new data streaming capability is available today in all AWS Regions except China Regions, AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, and Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Regions. We want you to evaluate this new capability and provide us with feedback. There are no charges for your usage at the beginning of the preview. At some point in the future, it will be priced based on your actual usage, for example, based on the quantity of bytes read and delivered. There are no commitments or upfront investments. Make sure to read the pricing page to get the details.\n\nNow, go configure your first continual database replication to Apache Iceberg tables on Amazon S3 and visit http://aws.amazon.com/firehose.",

        "content": "bpftune - BPF driven auto-tuning\n\nbpftune aims to provide lightweight, always-on auto-tuning of system behaviour. The key benefit it provides are\n\nby using BPF observability features, we can continuously monitor and adjust system behaviour\n\nbecause we can observe system behaviour at a fine grain (rather than using coarse system-wide stats), we can tune at a finer grain too (individual socket policies, individual device policies etc)\n\nThe problem\n\nThe Linux kernel contains a large number of tunables; these often take the form of sysctl(8) parameters, and are usually introduced for situations where there is no one \"right\" answer for a configuration choice. The number of tunables available is quite daunting. On a 6.2 kernel we see\n\n# sysctl --all 2>/dev/null|wc -l 1624\n\nSee here for an excellent writeup on network-related tunables..\n\nAt the same time, individual systems get a lot less care and adminstrator attention than they used to; phrases like \"cattle not pets\" exemplify this. Given the modern cloud architectures used for most deployments, most systems never have any human adminstrator interaction after initial provisioning; in fact given the scale requirements, this is often an explicit design goal - \"no ssh'ing in!\".\n\nThese two observations are not unrelated; in an earlier era of fewer, larger systems, tuning by administrators was more feasible.\n\nThese trends - system complexity combined with minimal admin interaction suggest a rethink in terms of tunable management.\n\nA lot of lore accumulates around these tunables, and to help clarify why we developed bpftune, we will use a straw-man version of the approach taken with tunables:\n\n\"find the set of magic numbers that will work for the system forever\"\n\nThis is obviously a caricature of how administrators approach the problem, but it does highlight a critical implicit assumption - that systems are static.\n\nAnd that gets to the \"BPF\" in bpftune; BPF provides means to carry out low-overhead observability of systems. So not only can we observe the system and tune appropriately, we can also observe the effect of that tuning and re-tune if necessary.\n\nKey design principles\n\nMinimize overhead. Use observability features sparingly; do not trace very high frequency events.\n\nBe explicit about policy changes providing both a \"what\" - what change was made - and a \"why\" - how does it help? syslog logging makes policy actions explicit with explanations\n\nGet out of the way of the administrator. We can use BPF observability to see if the admin sets tunable values that we are auto-tuning; if they do, we need to get out of the way and disable auto-tuning of the related feature set.\n\nDon't replace tunables with more tunables! bpftune is designed to be zero configuration; there are no options, and we try to avoid magic numbers where possible.\n\nUse push-pull approaches. For example, with tcp buffer sizing, we often want to get out of the way of applications and bump up tcp sndbuf and rcvbuf, but at a certain point we run the risk of exhausting TCP memory. We can however monitor if we are approaching TCP memory pressure and if so we can tune down values that we've tuned up. In this way, we can let the system find a balance between providing resources and exhausting them. In some cases, we won't need to tune up values; they may be fine as they are. But in other cases these limits block optimal performance, and if they are raised safely - with awareness of global memory limits - we can get out the way of improved performance. Another concern is that increasing buffer size leads to latency - to handle that, we correlate buffer size changes and TCP smoothed round-trip time; if the correlation between these exceeds a threshold (0.7) we stop increasing buffer size.\n\nConcepts\n\nThe key components are\n\ntuners: each tuner manages tunables and handles events sent from BPF programs to userspace via the shared ring buffer. Each tuner has an associated set of tunables that it manages.\n\noptional strategies: a tuner can specify multiple strategies; after running for a while a strategy times out and we assess if a better strategy is available. Each strategy specifies a name description timeout evaluation function set of BPF program names in tuner associated with strategy Strategies are optional and should be set in the tuner init() method via bpftune_strategies_add(). See test/strategy for a coded example. When a strategy times out, the various evaluation functions are called and the highest-value evaluation dictates the next stratgey. Strategies provide a way of providing multiple schemes for auto-tuning the same set of tunables, where the choice is guided by an evaluation of the effectiveness of the strategies.\n\nevents specify a tuner id: which tuner the event is destined for a scenario: what happened an associated netns (if supported) information about the event (IP address etc)\n\nthe tuner then responds to the event guided by the active strategy; increase or decrease a tunable value, etc. Describing the event in the log is key; this allows an admin to understand what changed and why.\n\nArchitecture\n\nbpftune is a daemon which manages a set of .so plugin tuners; each of these is a shared object that is loaded on start-up.\n\ntuners can be enabled or disabled; a tuner is automatically disabled if the admin changes associated tunables manually.\n\ntuners share a global BPF ring buffer which allows posting of events from BPF programs to userspace. For example, if the sysctl tuner sees a systl being set, it posts an event.\n\neach tuner has an associated id (set when it is loaded), and events posted contain the tuner id.\n\neach tuner has a BPF component (built using a BPF skeleton) and a userspace component. The latter has init(), fini() and event_handler() entrypoints. When an event is received, the tuner id is used to identify the appropriate event handler and its event_handler() callback function is run.\n\ninit, fini and event_handler functions are loaded from the tuner .so object.\n\nBPF components should include bpftune.bpf.h; it contains the common map definitions (ringbuf, etc) and shared variables such as learning rate and tuner ids that each tuner needs.\n\nSupported tuners\n\nTCP connection tuner: auto-tune choice of congestion control algorithm. See bpftune-tcp-conn (8).\n\nneighbour table tuner: auto-tune neighbour table sizes by growing tables when approaching full. See bpftune-neigh (8).\n\nroute table tuner: auto-tune route table size by growing tables when approaching full. See bpftune-route (8).\n\nsysctl tuner: monitor sysctl setting and if it collides with an auto-tuned sysctl value, disable the associated tuner. See bpftune-sysctl (8).\n\nTCP buffer tuner: auto-tune max and initial buffer sizes. See bpftune-tcp-buffer (8).\n\nnet buffer tuner: auto-tune tunables related to core networking. See bpftune-net-buffer (8).\n\nnetns tuner: notices addition and removal of network namespaces, which helps power namespace awareness for bpftune as a whole. Namespace awareness is important as we want to be able to auto-tune containers also. See bpftune-netns (8).\n\nCode organization\n\nBoth core bpftune.c and individual tuners use the libbpftune library. It handles logging, tuner init/fini, and BPF init/fini.\n\nEach tuner shared object defines an init(), fini() and event_handler() function. These respectively set up and clean up BPF and handle events that originate from the BPF code.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIf building the repository manually, simply run\n\n$ make ; sudo make install\n\nat the top-level of the repository. bpftune also supports a\n\n$ make pkg\n\ntarget, which will make a bpftune RPM. See ./buildrpm/bpftune.spec\n\nWe can also build with non-standard libdir for distros which do not use /usr/lib64 like CachyOS; in this case to install to /usr/lib instead\n\n$ make libdir=lib $ sudo make install libdir=lib\n\nTo build the following packages are needed (names may vary by distro);\n\nlibbpf, libbpf-devel >= 0.6\n\nlibcap-devel\n\nbpftool >= 4.18\n\nlibnl3-devel\n\nclang >= 11\n\nllvm >= 11\n\npython3-docutils\n\nFrom the kernel side, the kernel needs to support BPF ring buffer (around the 5.6 kernel, though 5.4 is supported on Oracle Linux as ring buffer support was backported), and kernel BTF is required (CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y). Verify /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux is present.\n\nTo enable bpftune as a service\n\n$ sudo service bpftune start\n\n...and to enable it by default\n\n$ sudo systemctl enable bpftune\n\nbpftune logs to syslog so /var/log/messages will contain details of any tuning carried out.\n\nbpftune can also be run in the foreground as a program; to redirect output to stdout/stderr, run\n\n$ sudo bpftune -s\n\nOn exit, bpftune will summarize any tuning done.\n\nTests\n\nTests are supplied for each tuner in the tests/ subdirectory. \"make test\" runs all the tests. Tests use network namespaces to simulate interactions with remote hosts. See ./TESTING.md for more details.\n\nDoes my system support bpftune?\n\nSimply run \"bpftune -S\" to see:\n\n$ bpftune -S bpftune works fully bpftune supports per-netns policy (via netns cookie)\n\nTwo aspects are important here\n\ndoes the system support fentry/fexit etc? If so full support is likely.\n\ndoes the system support network namespace cookies? If so per-network-namespace policy is supported.\n\nDemo\n\nSimply starting bpftune and observing changes made via /var/log/messages can be instructive. For example, on a standard VM with sysctl defaults, I ran\n\n$ service bpftune start\n\n...and went about normal development activities such as cloning git trees from upstream, building kernels, etc. From the log we see some of the adjustments bpftune made to accommodate these activities\n\n$ sudo grep bpftune /var/log/messages ...

Because loss rate has exceeded 1 percent for a connection, use bbr congestion control algorithm instead of default Apr 19 16:29:04 bpftest bpftune[2778]: due to loss events for 140.91.12.81, specify 'bbr' congestion control algorithm\n\nTo deterministically trigger bpftune behaviour, one approach we can take is to download a large file with inappropriate settings.\n\nIn one window, set tcp rmem max to a too-low value, and run bpftune as a program logging to stdout/stderr (-s):\n\n$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem=\"4096 131072 1310720\" net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 1310720 $ sudo bpftune -s\n\nIn another window, wget a large file:\n\n$ wget https://yum.oracle.com/ISOS/OracleLinux/OL8/u7/x86_64/OracleLinux-R8-U7-x86_64-dvd.iso\n\nIn the first window, we see bpftune tuning up rmem:\n\nbpftune: bpftune works in legacy mode bpftune: bpftune does not support per-netns policy (via netns cookie) bpftune: Scenario 'need to increase TCP buffer size(s)' occurred for tunable 'net.ipv4.tcp_rmem' in global ns. Need to increase buffer size(s) to maximize throughput bpftune: Due to need to increase max buffer size to maximize throughput change net.ipv4.tcp_rmem(min default max) from (4096 131072 1310720) -> (4096 131072 1638400)\n\nThis occurs multiple times, and on exit (Ctrl+C) we see the summary of changes made:\n\nbpftune: Summary: scenario 'need to increase TCP buffer size(s)' occurred 9 times for tunable 'net.ipv4.tcp_rmem' in global ns. Need to increase buffer size(s) to maximize throughput bpftune: sysctl 'net.ipv4.tcp_rmem' changed from (4096 131072 1310720 ) -> (4096 131072 9765625 )\n\nFor more info\n\nSee the docs/ subdirectory for manual pages covering bpftune and associated tuners.\n\nbpftune was presented at the eBPF summit; video here.\n\nbpftune was also discussed on Liz Rice's excellent eCHO eBPF podcast, specifically in the context of using reinforcement learning in BPF\n\nContributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions from the community.

Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralized lending platform Polter Finance suffered a devastating exploit on the Fantom blockchain, essentially wiping out most of its assets.\n\nThe breach, discovered early Sunday, involved the manipulation of the platform’s token pricing mechanisms, leaving its users in shock.\n\nThe attacker began by funneling funds through Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based coin mixer that conceals the origin of funds. These assets were then bridged—transferred from Ethereum to the Fantom network—where the exploit was executed.\n\nOnce the breach was identified, Polter Finance took immediate action by pausing its platform to contain the damage and notified key bridge operators.\n\nThe pseudonymous founder of Polter Finance, known as “Whichghost,” filed a police report in Singapore following the breach. The hack resulted in losses exceeding 16.1 million SGD (approximately $12 million USD).\n\nThe newly deployed smart contract on the platform was exploited, causing unauthorized transactions to drain user assets, says the report. The founder also reported personal losses of $223,219.\n\nWhile the police report claims total losses of around $12 million, other reports from web3 security firms suggest the actual amount stolen was closer to $7 million.\n\n🚨ALERT🚨@PolterFinance has reported an exploit on the #Fantom chain. Over $7M in digital assets have been stolen!\n\nTransaction: https://t.co/2sFDXiLkpm\n\n💰 The attacker was originally funded via @TornadoCash on #Ethereum, with funds later bridged to #Fantom.\n\nThe team has taken… https://t.co/dYgVzDdsoh pic.twitter.com/N1u5sh7BPf — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) November 18, 2024\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama data, Polter Finance’s TVL was approximately $9.7 million before the attack, indicating substantial losses.\n\nIn a statement on X (formerly Twitter), the team wrote, ““We identified wallets involved and traced it to Binance. We are still investigating the nature of the exploit. We are in the processing of contacting the Authorities.”\n\nThe platform was paused soon after the exploit was identified.\n\nBridges were notified.\n\nWe identified wallets involved and traced it to Binance.\n\nWe are still investigating the nature of the exploit.\n\nWe are in the processing of contacting the Authorities. — polterfinance💥 (@polterfinance) November 17, 2024\n\nThe platform also sent an on-chain message to the attacker, saying the team would be willing to negotiate without pursuing legal action if the stolen funds are returned.\n\nWeb3 security experts think the root cause of the exploit was linked to a price manipulation attack using oracles—external data feeds that platforms use to determine token prices.\n\nSmart contract audit firm QuillAudits shared their findings with Decrypt which shows the vulnerability was tied with how Polter Finance calculated the value of the SpookySwap BOO token.\n\n“The price of the SpookySwap BOO token in the lending pool was determined by the spot price from the SpookySwap v3 pool and v2 pair; calculated based on the token balance ratio in the pool,” QuillAudits told Decrypt.\n\nBy artificially increasing the price of the BOO token, the hacker could deposit a very small amount (just 1 BOO token) and withdraw a much larger amount of other assets, effectively draining the platform of its funds.\n\n“This case exemplifies a classic Oracle manipulation exploit. The BOO token price is manipulated by the attacker using a flash loan to artificially inflate the BOO token's price,” Hakan Unal, Senior Blockchain Scientist at Cyvers Ai, told Decrypt.\n\nPolter Finance announced it has since colllaborated with the Security Alliance Information Sharing and Analysis Center (SEAL-ISAC) to track down the hacker.\n\nThis incident adds to the growing list of security breaches in the crypto sector. The total amount lost to the exploits has surpassed $2 billion in 2024 alone, with code vulnerabilities resulting in $39.6 million in losses over 44 incidents, per a recent Certik report.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott.",

It is a step forward for the platform’s upcoming launch of the World Liberty Financial Aave v3 instance, which is still in the approval stage.\n\nAccess To DeFi Applications\n\nIn a press statement, World Liberty Financial said that the Protocol’s objective is to give users the opportunity to get information and gain access to third-party decentralized finance applications, a move that could further push the adoption of US dollar-based stablecoins and ensure that the greenbacks would still be the preferred currency of the world’s reserve.\n\nIt would allow Trump’s decentralized finance platform to become a pioneer in the decentralized finance DeFi space, drawing inspiration from Trump’s vision of more open access financial opportunities to keep the US dollar’s position in the global standing.\n\nChainlink Co-Founder Sergey Nazarov expressed their excitement with the alliance with World Liberty Financial and helped the platform in all their “data, cross-chain, and all other oracle network needs.”\n\n“The Chainlink standard is already widely used across DeFi and will help WLFI attract users that value the security and reliability that has already helped grow DeFi as an industry,” Nazarov remarked.\n\nBenefit Of Chainlink\n\nWorld Liberty Financial said that Chainlink would provide them with access to “market-leading on-chain data and cross-chain interoperability infrastructure”, adding that it is also an ecosystem that boasts a transaction value of more than $16 trillion in transaction value.\n\nWith the help of the Chainlink Price Feeds, the has taken a crucial step that will enable the platform to launch the Aave v3 instance.\n\nChainlink’s track record in security was among the primary reasons why World Liberty Financial selected the oracle provider.\n\nFeatured image from Brandon Bell/Getty Images, chart from TradingView",

        "content": "Nvidia, Oracle, Google, Dell and 13 other companies reported how long it takes their computers to train the key neural networks in use today. Among those results were the first glimpse of Nvidia’s next generation GPU, the B200, and Google’s upcoming accelerator, called Trillium. The B200 posted a doubling of performance on some tests versus today’s workhorse Nvidia chip, the H100. And Trillium delivered nearly a four-fold boost over the chip Google tested in 2023.\n\nThe benchmark tests, called MLPerf v4.1, consist of six tasks: recommendation, the pre-training of the large language models (LLM) GPT-3 and BERT-large, the fine tuning of the Llama 2 70B large language model, object detection, graph node classification, and image generation.\n\nTraining GPT-3 is such a mammoth task that it’d be impractical to do the whole thing just to deliver a benchmark. Instead, the test is to train it to a point that experts have determined means it is likely to reach the goal if you kept going. For Llama 2 70B, the goal is not to train the LLM from scratch, but to take an already trained model and fine-tune it so it’s specialized in a particular expertise—in this case,government documents. Graph node classification is a type of machine learning used in fraud detection and drug discovery.\n\nAs what’s important in AI has evolved, mostly toward using generative AI, the set of tests has changed. This latest version of MLPerf marks a complete changeover in what’s being tested since the benchmark effort began. “At this point all of the original benchmarks have been phased out,” says David Kanter, who leads the benchmark effort at MLCommons. In the previous round it was taking mere seconds to perform some of the benchmarks.\n\nPerformance of the best machine learning systems on various benchmarks has outpaced what would be expected if gains were solely from Moore’s Law [blue line]. Solid line represent current benchmarks. Dashed lines represent benchmarks that have now been retired, because they are no longer industrially relevant. MLCommons\n\nAccording to MLPerf’s calculations, AI training on the new suite of benchmarks is improving at about twice the rate one would expect from Moore’s Law. As the years have gone on, results have plateaued more quickly than they did at the start of MLPerf’s reign. Kanter attributes this mostly to the fact that companies have figured out how to do the benchmark tests on very large systems. Over time, Nvidia, Google, and others have developed software and network technology that allows for near linear scaling—doubling the processors cuts training time roughly in half.\n\nFirst Nvidia Blackwell training results\n\nThis round marked the first training tests for Nvidia’s next GPU architecture, called Blackwell. For the GPT-3 training and LLM fine-tuning, the Blackwell (B200) roughly doubled the performance of the H100 on a per-GPU basis. The gains were a little less robust but still substantial for recommender systems and image generation—64 percent and 62 percent, respectively.\n\nThe Blackwell architecture, embodied in the Nvidia B200 GPU, continues an ongoing trend toward using less and less precise numbers to speed up AI. For certain parts of transformer neural networks such as ChatGPT, Llama2, and Stable Diffusion, the Nvidia H100 and H200 use 8-bit floating point numbers. The B200 brings that down to just 4 bits.\n\nGoogle debuts 6th gen hardware\n\nGoogle showed the first results for its 6th generation of TPU, called Trillium—which it unveiled only last month—and a second round of results for its 5th generation variant, the Cloud TPU v5p. In the 2023 edition, the search giant entered a different variant of the 5th generation TPU, v5e, designed more for efficiency than performance. Versus the latter, Trillium delivers as much as a 3.8-fold performance boost on the GPT-3 training task.\n\nBut versus everyone’s arch-rival Nvidia, things weren’t as rosy. A system made up of 6,144 TPU v5ps reached the GPT-3 training checkpoint in 11.77 minutes, placing a distant second to an 11,616-Nvidia H100 system, which accomplished the task in about 3.44 minutes. That top TPU system was only about 25 seconds faster than an H100 computer half its size.\n\nA Dell Technologies computer fine-tuned the Llama 2 70B large language model using about 75 cents worth of electricity.\n\nIn the closest head-to-head comparison between v5p and Trillium, with each system made up of 2048 TPUs, the upcoming Trillium shaved a solid 2 minutes off of the GPT-3 training time, nearly an 8 percent improvement on v5p’s 29.6 minutes. Another difference between the Trillium and v5p entries is that Trillium is paired with AMD Epyc CPUs instead of the v5p’s Intel Xeons.\n\nGoogle also trained the image generator, Stable Diffusion, with the Cloud TPU v5p. At 2.6 billion parameters, Stable Diffusion is a light enough lift that MLPerf contestants are asked to train it to convergence instead of just to a checkpoint, as with GPT-3. A 1024 TPU system ranked second, finishing the job in 2 minutes 26 seconds, about a minute behind the same size system made up of Nvidia H100s.\n\nTraining power is still opaque\n\nThe steep energy cost of training neural networks has long been a source of concern. MLPerf is only beginning to measure this. Dell Technologies was the sole entrant in the energy category, with an eight-server system containing 64 Nvidia H100 GPUs and 16 Intel Xeon Platinum CPUs. The only measurement made was in the LLM fine-tuning task (Llama2 70B). The system consumed 16.4 megajoules during its 5-minute run, for an average power of 5.4 kilowatts. That means about 75 cents of electricity at the average cost in the United States.\n\nWhile it doesn’t say much on its own, the result does potentially provide a ballpark for the power consumption of similar systems. Oracle, for example, reported a close performance result—4 minutes 45 seconds—using the same number and types of CPUs and GPUs.",
