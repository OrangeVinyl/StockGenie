        "content": "Intel's 12th, 13th, & 14th gen CPUs are currently retailing for much lower than MSRP with the early Black Friday deals on Amazon and Newegg.\n\nGet the Intel Core i9 12900KS for under $240, the Core i5 13600KF for just $175, the flagship Core i9-14900K for $438, and significant discounts on many Intel CPUs\n\nBlack Friday 2024 is just two weeks away, but the deals aren't. In fact, the deals have already begun, and we have collected the list of the discount processors that will save you hundreds of dollars if you compare their MSRPs with current deal prices. This list includes a lot of Intel 12th, 13th, and 14th gen CPUs, all of them being offered at much lower prices that will offer great value for money.\n\nAs far as Intel's Alder Lake(12th gen) processors are considered, you can currently purchase five SKUs for a much lower price:\n\nThe Intel Core i9 12900KS CPU probably won't go as low as it is now. It is even cheaper than the Core i9 12900KF and is the flagship processor in the Alder Lake lineup. Featuring 16 cores and 24 threads with a clock speed of up to 5.50 GHz, it is the best possible and best-value LGA 1700 CPU to buy right now. It was launched for $739, which saves you around a staggering $500.\n\nOther deals such as the Intel Core i7 12700KF and Core i5 12600KF are also outstanding. One is available for under $200 while the other is under $150, respectively. Both offer incredible gaming performance and decent productivity as well.\n\nFor newer generations, like Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh, here are the current best deals:\n\nAll of these chips are fabulous when it comes to multitasking, CPU-oriented programs, and heavy workloads. Surprisingly, these chips are better than the current-gen Arrow Lake CPUs in gaming and with the current deals, they will offer much higher fps per cost.\n\nFor medium-intensive tasks and gaming, we recommend going with the Core i5 series. For intensive tasks and productivity, the Core i7 chips will be a cost-effective yet powerful computing solution. However, for very intensive stuff where every second matters, get the Core i9s to get the job done in a few minutes.\n\nWe will be back again with more such deals on AMD CPUs too. Stay tuned for more such discounts as this will be the best time for you to build a gaming PC.",

        "content": "Commissions haven’t changed much since the NAR settlement terms went into effect, but early signs show where things may be heading, dueling surveys by AccountTECH and Inman Intel show.\n\nWhether it’s refining your business model, mastering new technologies, or discovering strategies to capitalize on the next market surge, Inman Connect New York will prepare you to take bold steps forward. The Next Chapter is about to begin. Be part of it. Join us and thousands of real estate leaders Jan. 22-24, 2025.\n\nDespite fears that commissions would face downward pressure in the wake of the National Association of Realtors’ antitrust lawsuit settlement terms going into effect, rates have largely remained steady, according to an AccountTECH analysis that tracks closely with findings from October’s Inman Intel Index.\n\nTAKE THE INMAN INTEL INDEX SURVEY FOR NOVEMBER\n\nSeller agent commissions actually improved modestly on an annual basis, according to AccountTECH’s study, with seller agents receiving an average commission rate of 2.77 percent in the 30 days after the Aug. 17 settlement, up from 2.75 percent during those same 30 days in 2023. In the 60 days after the settlement, seller agents saw an average commission of 2.738 percent, up from 2.724 percent during those same 60 days in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, buyer agents saw minimal declines in their commission rates. During the 30 days following the settlement, buyer agents earned an average commission of 2.545 percent, down from 2.595 percent during the same 30-day period in 2023. Over the 60 days following the settlement, buyer agents earned an average commission of 2.486 percent, down from 2.541 percent during the same 60 days in 2023.\n\nFor its analysis, AccountTECH reviewed data from 625 real estate offices, reviewing transactions where the date the sales transaction went under agreement was within 60 days of the Aug. 17 settlement deadline. The total number of buyer side transactions that went pending during the 60-day period by the 625 real estate offices analyzed was 17,358, down slightly from 19,274 buyer side transactions during the same period in 2023.\n\nAs of late September, 45 percent of agents told Inman Intel that they had not yet seen a reduction in commissions.\n\nIn addition, fewer than 11 percent of active homesellers told Intel in early October that they were taking a firm stance against covering the buyer’s agent commissions while just 9 percent of agents reported that a significant share of sellers were taking a hardline approach against covering the buyer’s agent fee.\n\nEarly findings from an Inman-Dig Insights consumer survey on the buy-side of the transaction show a bit more desire for negotiation from consumers, however.\n\nNearly 1 in 5 active homebuyers in early October said they agreed to pay only 1.5 percent or less of the home purchase price to their buyer’s agent, according to the Inman-Dig Insights consumer survey. Similarly, just under 19 percent of buyers told Intel they were successful in negotiating their buyer-side commission downwards with their agent.\n\nThe Inman Intel Index survey was conducted from Sept. 18-Oct. 4, 2024, and received 441 responses from Inman readers. The Inman-Dig Insights consumer survey was conducted from Oct. 4-6, 2024, and sampled a diverse group of 3,000 American adults from age 24 to 65.\n\nThe annual decline in buyer-side transactions that AccountTECH’s survey found is something to watch in the year ahead, the real estate accounting software company noted, even though the decline in transactions could just as likely be a result of interest rates, inventory or other economic conditions as it could be a result of the NAR settlement.\n\nFor now, the decline in buyer-side commissions is also within the range of “normal market variation,” AccountTECH said. But it is something that analysts and other industry stakeholders will want to keep an eye on.\n\n“Industry watchers should keep tracking this number closely since a continuation of this two-month trend of 0.05 percent decrease per month would bring commission rates on the buyer side to 2 percent by June 2025,” AccountTECH’s report said.\n\nEmail Lillian Dickerson",
        "summary": "The National Association of Realtors' antitrust lawsuit settlement has not significantly impacted commission rates, with seller agent commissions slightly increasing and buyer agent commissions experiencing minimal declines. AccountTECH's analysis of 625 real estate offices showed a slight decrease in buyer-side transactions, which could be attributed to various economic factors rather than the settlement itself. Surveys indicate that a minority of sellers are resisting covering buyer agent commissions, while some buyers are successfully negotiating lower commission rates. The Inman-Dig Insights consumer survey revealed that nearly 20% of buyers managed to negotiate their commission down to 1.5% or less. Industry analysts are advised to monitor these trends closely, as continued decreases in buyer-side commissions could lead to significant changes by mid-2025.",

        "content": "In the wake of President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to appoint ex-Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as his Director of National Intelligence, reports have resurfaced of her ties to a religious sect described as a “cult”—a connection that has the potential to throw her nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, into jeopardy.\n\nGabbard became the first American Samoan and practicing Hindu in Congress when she joined the U.S. House representing Hawaii’s 2nd congressional district in 2013. She reportedly met her husband, Abraham Williams, just a year before when he volunteered to shoot a video for her campaign.\n\nIn addition to bonding over a love of surfing , The Daily Mail reported that the couple also was mutually connected to the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF), a group with a history of antagonism toward LGBTQ people, women and Muslims. The group’s leader, Chris Butler, is heralded by members as a deity in his own right.\n\nThe SIF, described as an alt-right branch of Hare Krishna, has reportedly developed thousands of followers across Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia—with Butler being heralded as an extension of God.\n\n“I was raised to believe Chris Butler was God’s voice on Earth, and if you question him or offended him in any way, you were effectively offending God,” said a former SIF member in a 2017 Medium post.\n\nGabbard’s aunt, Dr. Caroline Sinavaiana Gabbard, was blunt about her views on the organization, and her niece’s involvement in a 2022 interview with The Independent .\n\n“Once again I find my niece’s apparent penchant for parroting extremist toadies such as Tucker Carlson and vile strongmen such as Vladimir Putin, to be problematic and deeply troubling,” she said. “​It gives me no pleasure to ​note that Tulsi’s single governing principle seems to be expedience, which is in effect no principle at all.”\n\nCaroline also alleged that Gabbard’s 2020 presidential bid was the result of Butler’s pursuit of political influence, with Gabbard openly praising Butler as her “guru .”\n\nAmid open backlash against her nomination for the coveted intelligence role, the reports of her ties to the fringe religious sect could result in more pushback against Gabbard—especially after she was previously connected to a Russian spy .\n\nJohn Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security advisor to President Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019, called Gabbard the “worst cabinet-level appointment in history” in a CNN interview (That is, until Bolton heard about Matt Gaetz being nominated as attorney general ).\n\n“Now we are going to see whether the American Senate can stand up and reject two people who are totally unqualified, unfit professionally, and really lacking in the moral character you need to hold these jobs,” said Bolton. “I think this vote should be 100 to nothing against both of them.”\n\nAs one senior former intelligence official told Politico , Trump’s nomination of Gabbard was a “left turn and off the bridge.”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.",

        "content": "Federal grant documents that contained a “blueprint” for creating the virus that causes COVID-19 may have been wrongly classified by the Defense Department, leading to a “flawed” probe of the pandemic’s origins by US intelligence agencies, according to whistleblower documents exclusively obtained by The Post.\n\nThe whistleblower, Marine Corps. Lt. Col. Joseph Murphy — who now runs the military branch’s Warfighting Lab based at Quantico, Va. — discovered in July 2021 that the unclassified grant proposal, known as Project DEFUSE, had been uploaded to a classified portal and notified his chain of command.\n\nThe DEFUSE proposal, which has since been cited by scientists as “ smoking gun ” evidence that COVID was engineered in a Chinese lab, was not included — despite being unclassified — in a final Office of Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) report on the virus’ origins released in August 2021 .\n\nMurphy was unable to uncover why the proposal had been over-classified, and it was never used in the ODNI report, despite the fact that it had been submitted to the Intelligence Community (IC) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where he worked at the time.\n\nFederal grant documents that contained a “blueprint” for creating the virus that causes COVID-19 may have been wrongly classified by the Defense Department, leading to a “flawed” intel probe. Getty Images\n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) revealed the whistleblower files in a Thursday letter to Intelligence Community Inspector General Thomas Monheim and called for a thorough investigation into whether “the DEFUSE records were impeded, misdirected or if the significance of the proposal was downplayed by advisors or staff.”\n\n“The ODNI assessment remains flawed,” added Marshall, pointing to the documents as well as earlier reports that “conflicted individuals may have censored the laboratory-origin related intelligence.”\n\n“[I]f true, this signals an alarming breach of integrity in the investigative process,” he said. “Today I write with urgency to request that your office investigate the federal government’s COVID-19 origin analytical process and results.”\n\nOn May 26, 2021, President Biden ordered ODNI to launch a 90-day investigation into whether the COVID-19 pandemic, which killed more than 1.2 million Americans, began with a laboratory accident or was the product of natural spillover from animals to humans.\n\n“The ODNI assessment remains flawed,” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) wrote in a Thursday letter to Intelligence Community Inspector General Thomas Monheim. Getty Images\n\nRand Paul to target ‘COVID cover-up’ as head of Senate Homeland Security committee\n\nThe review resulted in the US Intelligence Community returning a “ divided ” verdict on COVID origins, saying a lab leak and and natural spillover were equally likely. Only the FBI and Energy Department pointed to a lab leak as the most likely cause.\n\nThe DEFUSE papers, however, reveal plans to engineer a coronavirus that would have had identical characteristics to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nManhattan-based nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance submitted the proposal to DARPA in May 2018 — but it was never funded.\n\nEcoHealth has since been suspended , however, from receiving all federal grants after it “likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety” and failed to submit reviews of experiments it conducted at the now-infamous and debarred Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).\n\nEcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak submitted the proposal to DARPA in May 2018 — but it was never funded. Getty Images\n\nThe COVID pandemic originated in the same Chinese city — more than 800 miles from the closest bats that could have infected humans with the SARS-CoV-2 viruses — at a lab that was world-renowned for its research on bat coronaviruses and conducted US-taxpayer funded, gain-of-function experiments on them from 2014 to 2021.\n\nThe “Defusing the Threat of Bat-borne Coronaviruses” grant, as it was titled, involved University of North Carolina researcher Dr. Ralph Baric and Wuhan of Institute Virology collaborator Dr. Shi Zhengli, nicknamed the “bat lady” for her expertise in the subject.\n\nThey planned to conduct risky gain-of-function experiments — one of the reasons DARPA denied the grant — to increase the infectiousness of bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab.\n\nMarshall’s missive noted that Baric may have been one of the private sector scientists that ODNI consulted during its probe, an obvious conflict of interest since he previously admitted to being a part of the IC agency’s Biological Sciences Experts Group.\n\nThe “Defusing the Threat of Bat-borne Coronaviruses” grant, as it was titled, involved University of North Carolina researcher Dr. Ralph Baric and a Wuhan of Institute Virology collaborator. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n“Undisclosed conflicts of interest may have included professional reliance on federal grants, a bias towards risky pathogen research projects, or collaborative relationships with the WIV,” the Kansas Republican said.\n\nElon Musk doubles down on going after Fauci: ‘My pronouns are still prosecute/Fauci’\n\nGain-of-function experiments were also still conducted , eventually leading to EcoHealth’s suspension, via $1.4 million in grants and subgrants that flowed from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nEcoHealth has repeatedly denied that it funded the research — contradicting sworn testimony from NIH Principal Deputy Director Dr. Lawrence Tabak — and a spokesperson previously told The Post its work had not “violated any terms of NIH’s grant” and “oversight of experiments adhered to NIH grant award conditions.”\n\nThose grants greenlighted “genetic experiments to combine naturally occurring bat coronaviruses with SARS and MERS viruses, resulting in hybridized (also known as chimeric) coronavirus strains” between 2014 and 2019, according to a June 2023 Government Accountability Office report .\n\nGain-of-function experiments were conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the NIH later acknowledged. AFP via Getty Images\n\nFormer Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield suggested on a biosecurity panel at the University of North Carolina in October that even unfunded projects can be tested under other research grants.\n\nDrafts and notes of DEFUSE obtained by US Right to Know also show EcoHealth President Dr. Peter Daszak saying he would “ downplay ” the involvement of the Wuhan lab when asking for DARPA to fund the project.\n\nRedfield is one of several former intelligence and public health officials — including newly nominated CIA Director John Ratcliffe — who believe a lab leak is the most likely explanation for the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\nThe Intercept first revealed the existence of the DARPA grant proposal, which proposed the “exact feature” of a furin cleavage site later found in the virus, in September 2021.\n\nFormer Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield suggested on a biosecurity panel that even unfunded projects can be tested under other research grants. Getty Images\n\nAccording to the whistleblower documents, the agency dismissed that the proposal had been improperly uploaded to a classified network without official markings, in violation of federal policy.\n\n“[T]he storage, handling, and marking of the documents in question is consistent with DARPA and DoD policies and procedures concurrent with the origination of the files,” a controlled unclassified information report from the Department of Defense’s Office of Inspector General noted.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\n\nMurphy’s disclosures “do NOT support the allegation of concealment/cover-up or withholding information from interagency partners with a legitimate need to know,” the report states.\n\nDaszak and Fauci have strenuously denied that the COVID pandemic started from a laboratory accident or originated from gain-of-function experiments at the WIV — with the former NIAID director frequently smearing lab-leak proponents as “ conspiracy theorists .”\n\n$1.4 million in grants and subgrants flowed from the US Agency for International Development and Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to the WIV. POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn his letter, Marshall countered: “No SARS2 genomic or serological evidence was found in the over 80,000 domestic and wild animal samples tested in China.”\n\nA CDC workshop held in China in May 2019 also concluded that zoonotic spread was incredibly unlikely, saying that: “Of the 30 most dangerous zoonotic pathogens poised for outbreak in China, coronavirus only ranked as number 21,” he wrote.\n\nA year earlier, a joint EcoHealth-WIV study found “that Wuhan inhabitants had very low risk of exposure to bat coronavirus infections and used 240 samples from the Wuhan population to establish the control group benchmark for their studies,” Marshall added.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines was in charge during the COVID origins probe. Getty Images\n\nMarshall concluded by urging Monheim to find out whether “an integrity breach occurred during the federal probe and that the ODNI assessments may have errors, omissions or manipulated intelligence.”\n\n“The OIG investigation can uncover any deliberate actions which may rise to the level of misconduct, false statements, obstruction of federal proceedings, conspiracy, conflicts of interest, or infractions of administrative or civil laws,” he added.\n\nRutgers University molecular biologist Dr. Richard Ebright told The Post on Thursday that an inspector general’s investigation into the matter would be “a first step” toward accountability for COVID’s origins .\n\nRutgers University molecular biologist Dr. Richard Ebright told The Post on Thursday that an inspector general’s investigation into the matter would be “a first step” toward accountability for COVID’s origins. Homeland Security\n\n“I agree with Senator Marshall that DoD and IC officials likely engaged in ‘deliberate actions which may rise to the level of misconduct, false statements, obstruction of federal proceedings, conspiracy, conflicts of interest, or infractions of administrative or civil laws’ and that a DoD OIG investigation is needed, as a first step, to expose and ensure accountability for such actions,” Ebright said.\n\nReps for ODNI, the Pentagon and Monheim’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMurphy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com.",

Measuring 14.33 x 10.47 x 1.19 inches and with a starting weight of 6.5 pounds, it’s considerably larger than portability-focused workstations, such as the ThinkPad P1 Gen 7 and the HP ZBook Studio 16 G11.\n\nThe build quality of this laptop is exemplary. It’s MIL-SPEC certified for operation in harsh environments, and its tank-like chassis exhibits no flex. Most of the construction is made of magnesium and aluminum. Lenovo has the environment in mind, using recycled materials throughout, even on the keyboard. It also uses low-temperature solder and plastic-free packaging with 90% recycled and sustainable content.\n\nThe abundant physical connections include two Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C) ports, two 5Gbps USB Type-A ports, a 10Gbps USB Type-C port, HDMI 2.1 monitor output, and a 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nHaving some of the ports on the rear, especially the power plug, is useful for keeping cables out of the way. A red stripe back here adds flair to the otherwise understated design.\n\nA SmartCard reader and an SD card reader are optional. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are standard; NFC and 4G WWAN with eSIM are options.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen 2 Screen and Input Devices\n\nThinkPad keyboards are the best in the business; the P16 Gen 2 offers superb typing comfort, with ample key throw for satisfying tactile feedback. The white backlighting looks good in the dark. The productive layout has a separated arrow-key cluster and a full-size numeric keypad with a standard layout.\n\nThe large buttonless touchpad is joined by the trademark eraser-head pointing stick in the center of the keyboard, which has three dedicated buttons. The middle button is handy for apps that make use of center-click.\n\nThe ThinkPad’s screen options start with a 1920 x 1200 IPS panel rated for 300 or 400 nits of brightness and 100% sRGB gamut coverage. Our unit has the mid-tier 2560 x 1600 panel offering 500 nits and a gaming laptop-like 165Hz refresh rate. Everything we put on this screen looked outstanding, from office documents to movie trailers. The top option is a 3840 x 2400 OLED touchscreen with 100% DCI-P3 coverage.\n\nThe onboard webcam is rated 1080p and has a mechanical shutter for privacy. The camera will get the job done for video calls and such, although the sensor left a bit to be desired for image quality.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen 2 Upgradeability\n\nThis ThinkPad has excellent upgrade prospects. The bottom cover has a unique cutout for memory and SSD upgrades, eliminating the need to remove the entire panel.\n\nWith the entire bottom panel removed, we can see the large cooling fans and massive user-replaceable 94Wh battery.\n\nRemoving the thermal heatsinks shows how much copper this laptop uses to keep it running cool. While the system is under both a CPU and GPU load, fan noise isn’t that bad. It’s a soft to moderate whisper, thanks in part to larger fan intakes and outlets. It can move air well without ramping into really high fan RPM.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen 2 Performance\n\nOur review unit features a Core i7-14700HX processor, 32GB of RAM (non-ECC), a 1TB SSD, and an Nvidia RTX 4000 Ada Generation GPU (115W maximum graphics power). It retails for about $5,000, but pricing will vary by channel.\n\nFor comparison, we used the HP ZBook Power G11 and G11 A, the former featuring an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and the latter an AMD Ryzen 9 Pro 8945HS. Both have 64GB of RAM and an RTX 3000 Ada Generation GPU. The comparison is not precisely apples to apples, but it will put the ThinkPad’s stellar performance in perspective.\n\nSPECworkstation 3\n\nSPECworkstation3 specializes in benchmarks designed to test all key aspects of workstation performance. It uses over 30 workloads to test CPU, graphics, I/O, and memory bandwidth. The workloads fall into broader categories such as Media and Entertainment, Financial Services, Product Development, Energy, Life Sciences, and General Operations. We will list each broad-category result instead of the individual workloads. The results are an average of all the individual workloads in each category.\n\nThe ThinkPad P16 Gen 2, powered by the Nvidia RTX 4000 Ada, quickly showed its superiority in multiple categories.

        "content": "Bitsight acquires threat intelligence provider Cybersixgill for $115M\nBitsight Technologies Inc. has inked a $115 million deal to buy Cybersixgill Inc., a fellow cybersecurity startup that collects information about hacker activities.\nThe companies announced the acquisition today.\nBoston-based Bitsight is backed by about $400 million in venture funding. It raised the bulk of that sum, $250 million, from credit ratings agency Moody’s Corp. in a 2021 deal. Bitsight provides a platform that can map out a company’s technology assets, scan them for cybersecurity issues and then rank the discovered vulnerabilities by severity.\nThe software maker also offers a number of other features. One tool, Trust Management Hub, helps companies demonstrate the security of their infrastructure to customers. Additionally, Bitsight has built an analytics engine that enables organizations to identify areas for improvement in their breach prevention programs and check how they compare against industry peers.\nCybersixgill, meanwhile, provides a cloud-based threat intelligence platform. The service gives organizations access to data about hacking campaigns that they can use to inform their breach detection and mitigation efforts. The company counts multiple Fortune 500 enterprises among its customers.\nIt says that it collects several million data points daily from about 1,000 hacker forums and marketplaces. According to Cybersixgill, its algorithms gather records such as deleted posts that are often difficult for other threat intelligence platforms to access. Meanwhile, an artificial intelligence feature called Cybersixgill IQ distills the raw data collected by the company into natural language summaries that are easier for information technology teams to analyze.\nCustomers have the option to customize the platform’s data feeds. Using a built-in alerting tool, administrators can have Cybersixgill notify them if records belonging to employees or customers shows up in a hacker forum. When researchers discover a vulnerability in a software product, the platform correlates it with external data points to determine what risk it may pose to a company’s systems.\nBitsight plans to integrate Cybersixgill’s technology into its software portfolio after the acquisition closes. According to the companies, the goal is to help organizations more easily put threat intelligence to use. Additionally, Bitsight will apply Cybersixgill’s AI features to its internal repository of cybersecurity data.\n“With the integration of Cybersixgill’s team and technology, we can deliver even deeper insights to Bitsight customers about the targeted threats unique to their infrastructure,” said Bitsight Chief Executive Officer Steve Harvey.\nThe deal is not the company’s first acquisition. In 2021, it acquired a startup called VisibleRisk Inc. that likewise counted Moody’s as an investor. The deal bought Bitsight a platform that uses simulated cyberattacks to evaluate the effectiveness of companies’ cybersecurity systems.\nImage: Pixabay\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Inside Nutanix’s AI evolution: Simplifying AI/ML workloads with scalable solutions\nAs the urge to support artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads at an enterprise scale skyrockets, having an AI-ready platform is vital.\nNutanix has addressed this need with its Enterprise AI solution, which simplifies the deployment of large language models by leveraging its hyperconverged infrastructure. This scalable solution meets the demanding needs of AI/ML workloads and provides the flexibility to operate in private, public and hybrid cloud environments, according to Luke Congdon (pictured), senior director of product management at Nutanix Inc.\n“We just released what we’re calling Nutanix Enterprise AI, and it’s our new product line to say we are an AI company,” Congdon said. “We are offering generative AI on-premises now with inference endpoints, with security, with cost control, with simplicity, which is what we’ve always been trying to do.”\nCongdon spoke with theCUBE Research’s Savannah Peterson and Rob Strechay at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the key role that Nutanix Enterprise AI plays in simplifying infrastructure management. (* Disclosure below.)\nHow partnerships fit into the Nutanix Enterprise AI picture\nTo drive AI-driven innovations, partnerships play a vital role, as critical issues, such as comprehensive data management and analytics capabilities, must be effectively addressed. As a result, Nutanix teams up with various players, such as Hugging Face Inc. and Nvidia Corp, to make solutions such as Nutanix Enterprise AI a reality, according to Congdon.\n“Partnerships, I think, are the way to do it,” he said. “Even on the NAI announcement, we partnered with Hugging Face for access to their hub because they’ve got all the models in the world. What I love about it is that these are kind of turbocharged engines and, for the most part, they’re free. They’re Apache II or Meta-licensed. We’ve also partnered with Nvidia, and we’ve been doing that for years both on the GPU side for virtual desktop, as well for their AI for Enterprise suite and their NIMs products.”\nTo streamline IT operations by supporting Kubernetes deployments and multicloud environments, Nutanix made a strategic acquisition of D2iQ Inc. This move was meant to simplify containerized application development, making it easier to manage complex and distributed workloads across different infrastructures, Congdon pointed out.\n“We’d like to make sure that you’re going to get production-level Kubernetes with security, with load balancing, with ingress, with everything else that you need, because Kubernetes is really great, but it’s one key important orchestrator piece,” he said. “You need so much more. What’s really unique about them coming to Nutanix is they got what has traditionally really been hard for Kubernetes … stateful storage across objects, files, volumes, anything that you need.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA:\n(* Disclosure: Nutanix Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "Aviatrix prepares companies for a ‘cloud 2.0 strategy’\nIn the era of generative artificial intelligence, multicloud networking is essential.\nEnterprise companies are entering a new stage of cloud architecture, according to Anirban Sengupta (pictured), chief technology officer of engineering at Aviatrix Systems Inc. The company recently announced Aviatrix Cloud Network Security Platform-as-a-Service, enabling customers to simplify their multicloud networking in a secure manner.\n“With the coming of the gen AI and all these applications, what has happened is that the data is distributed,” Sengupta said. “The models are in a different place … and a lot of the data is actually on the edge. All that data has to come into the cloud so that it can be processed, and either for training or inference or any of these use cases. This is the time when there is a real need for having a true multicloud [strategy].”\nSengupta spoke with theCUBE Research’s Savannah Peterson and Rob Strechay at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the complexities of multicloud networking and why a security strategy is crucial for enterprise businesses. (* Disclosure below.)\nEntering the next stage of multicloud networking\nThe enterprise world is embracing what Sengupta calls a “cloud 2.0 strategy,” which involves taking advantage of the best-of-breed offerings of multiple clouds. Kubernetes allows for flexibility as customers mix and match different clouds for their needs.\n“Most [companies] started with AWS because that was the incumbent cloud, but now, over time, they’re looking at, ‘Hey, it’s not just AWS, but all the other clouds provide great value,’” Sengupta explained. “Especially with Kubernetes, it has become kind of shifting, and then on top of that, all the AI, gGen AI, and AI/ML applications, people are really looking at a cloud 2.0 strategy, so to speak, which is a 100% multicloud oriented.”\nMany of Aviatrix’s customers are in healthcare and finance, where the data has to be secure. When companies try to construct a multicloud architecture, they can run into several problems, according to Sengupta: Internet Protocol (IP) exhaustion and overlap, as well as network security for Virtual Private Clouds. Aviatrix aims to remedy these issues.\n“We have customers who have … more than a thousand island VPCs with overlapping IP space,” Sengupta said. “What we do is, because it’s controller-based, it can really take intent-based policies, networking and security policies, and they can connect all these overlapping IP address clusters through the NAT gateway … and our customers can go and write intent-based policies with the Kubernetes resources without caring about the IP addresses.”\nCompanies should have a time to value of under 10 minutes, according to Sengupta. He highlights the time-saving and secure features of Aviatrix PaaS, which allows customers to quickly implement its technology.\n“We take away the toil of the operations from our customers,” he said. “We take care of all upgrades, data operations, troubleshooting, making sure that everything is running as needed, and they’re getting the best operational excellence through SRE. For example, we take care of right sizing all these devices. And last but not the least is that we provide the best TCO overall with the PaaS service.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA:\n(* Disclosure: Aviatrix Systems Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "Applied Materials beats expectations but modest sales outlook weighs on stock\nApplied Materials Inc. posted higher-than-anticipated earnings and revenue thanks to increased demand for artificial intelligence chips and electronic devices, but its stock fell as company officials issued a mixed outlook for the current quarter.\nThe maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment reported fourth quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.32 per share, far ahead of the analysts’ consensus estimate of $2.19. Meanwhile, revenue rose 5% from a year earlier, to $7.05 billion, above Wall Street’s target of $6.96 billion.\nAll told, the company delivered a net profit of $1.73 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, down from the $2 billion profit it recorded in the year-ago period.\nHowever, it was the guidance for the current quarter that set the cat among the pigeons. Analysts were disappointed that the company is only guiding for first-quarter revenue of $7.15 billion at the midpoint of its forecast, below the analysts’ target of $7.24 billion. On the other hand, the company does at least expect a better profit, forecasting earnings of $2.29 per share, slightly higher than the consensus estimate of $2.27.\nApplied Materials Chief Executive Gary Dickerson (pictured) said on a conference call that the company is still in a good position to benefit from the industry’s bullish view on AI and energy-efficient computing. “As these key drivers of semiconductor innovation continue to grow in importance, the industry’s roadmap is becoming increasingly dependent on materials engineering, where Applied is the clear leader,” Dickerson said.\nApplied Materials is a supplier of sophisticated chipmaking equipment that’s used at the facilities of major chipmakers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Because of this, the company is seen as a key barometer of future demand in the chipmaking industry. Those customers generally order machinery from it well in advance of the opening of new chipmaking factories and upgrades to existing lines, which can take more than a year to outfit for production.\nDuring the quarter, Applied Material’s semiconductor systems business unit – by far its biggest – delivered revenue of $5.18 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Sales in the global services segment rose 11%, to $1.64 billion, while revenue from the much smaller display and adjacent markets unit fell 29% to $211 million.\nDespite beating expectations, the market likely has concerns that Applied Materials’ revenue growth has essentially stalled when adjusting for inflation, said analyst Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc.\n“It hasn’t been able to catch onto the generative AI wave, with its main foundry business retrenching for the full year, while the DRAM and applied global services units barely made up for the shortfall,” the analyst said. “The company also posted a lower profit, and that is not something investors want to see. It occurred due to the growth of ‘other income’ at the expense of its main business line, but that is less profitable.”\nMueller said investors are likely worried about the company’s prospects going forward. “Gary Dickerson and team have their work cut out in the next full year,” he added.\nThe real concern over Applied Materials stems from its declining revenue in China. There, it reported revenue fell 28% from a year ago, to $2.14 billion. Last month, analysts had warned that Applied Materials might be hurt by slowing demand for dynamic random access memory in China, and it has also been hurt by the U.S. government’s ongoing demands that chipmaking equipment manufacturers refrain from selling advanced technology to customers in that country.\nApplied Materials’ Chinese sales are therefore dwindling, despite the fact that China’s domestic chipmaking industry is seeing rapid growth of late. It isn’t helped by the fact the U.S. Department’s of Justice and Commerce are both investigating the company’s dealings in that country. Though it has not yet been accused of any wrongdoing, those investigations reportedly concern violations of the U.S. sanctions on Chinese chipmakers.\nShares of Applied Materials fell almost 6% in extended trading, but the stock still remains up just over 13% in the year to date.\nPhoto: Applied Materials/YouTube\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "TheCUBE analysis: Cloud-native infrastructure reshapes the future of scalable, AI-driven environments\nCloud-native infrastructure is rapidly changing as companies seek to streamline, scale and secure their digital environments.\nAs modern technology increasingly depends on platform engineering and artificial intelligence-driven solutions, a new balance is emerging between traditional DevOps practices and the unique demands of platform engineering. Both approaches are now competing to solve complex challenges in cloud-native and Kubernetes-focused ecosystems, driving the industry toward more integrated, scalable and accessible solutions.\nWith fresh innovations and collaborative frameworks on the rise, tech leaders are setting ambitious goals for making high-performance, large-scale operations a reality, according to Rob Strechay (pictured, right), managing director and principal analyst at theCUBE Research, and Savannah Peterson (left), principal analyst for devices, developers and edge at theCUBE Research.\n“We’ve been talking big conversation about DevOps versus platform engineering, the healthy tension there,” Peterson said. “I do feel there’s this return to platform engineering. I’m not surprised they dedicated a full day to it. Today’s theme being security also not a big surprise. And tomorrow’s theme being the 10-year anniversary of Kubernetes, which we’ve really been celebrating all year long since Paris, which is pretty exciting and across a few other events.”\nStrechay and Peterson gave their keynote analysis during day 2 at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the evolving role of platform engineering and cloud-native infrastructure, with a focus on scaling AI-driven and Kubernetes ecosystems, addressing challenges in scalability, accessibility and community inclusivity as the industry strives for sustainable digital transformation. (* Disclosure below.)\nPlatform engineering, cloud-native infrastructure and the return to scalable solutions\nPlatform engineering took center stage, with speakers highlighting the emerging focus on scaling infrastructure for the future of AI and Kubernetes ecosystems. Discussions around platform engineering versus DevOps illuminated a significant shift. Many argued that while DevOps traditionally supports operational efficiency, platform engineering is carving out its own role in large-scale environments where Kubernetes and AI intersect.\n“I think the community is just so vibrant,” Strechay said. “Some of the things that were going on today, yesterday was really around platform engineering as part of the keynote. It was a big platform engineering day. We had Chen [Goldberg] and Peter [Salanki] on after they were off the main stage, and they talked about how they’re using Kubernetes at CoreWeave to scale out their AI infrastructure for being able to build a GPU CSP for the future, train large language models. What they’re doing and how they were actually pulling it all together was really interesting and we got to dig in on that as well.”\nThese conversations revealed a unique dynamic in the community: a blend of veteran tech professionals and innovative startups collaborating to refine the Kubernetes landscape. Scaling is often the biggest challenge, requiring tools and infrastructure that can handle high-performance demands without compromising security, according to industry leaders.\n“I think what really struck me was, and there’s been this really interesting undercurrent from yesterday, was, ‘Oh, Kubernetes is boring now. It’s all solved,’ Strechay said. “Then we had the opposite when we were talking to [Goldberg] and [Salanki], like yeah, it’s still pretty complicated, especially, and I think the word is at scale. And I think when you start to go around … a lot of people talking about how do you get to scale and how do you really productionalize all of this?”\nThe CNCF, which oversees Kubernetes, also held discussions on project health and maturity, underscoring a commitment to long-term support for new technologies and startups in the cloud-native space. With numerous projects at different stages of development, CNCF representatives emphasized the importance of supporting projects through the graduation process, fostering a mature ecosystem for the future.\n“To your point of things we’ve seen move up in maturity, I think that was part of what they were talking about. And today’s keynote was Project Health and things of that nature,” Strechay said. “I think there’s still a lot that has to happen with them bringing together all of these different voices and getting enough healthy projects to graduation. I think that’s still a big theme and a big effort for the CNCF.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA:\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA.

        "content": "Profiling and workload management: MultiKueue and OpenTelemetry’s role in AI and observability\nKubeCon is a simultaneous celebration and solemn assessment of open-source advancement over time. A major theme at this week’s event is MultiKueue, an artificial intelligence-driven project that helps manage distributed workloads across multiple clusters.\nMultiKueue and OpenTelemetry are two such initiatives enabling AI models to queue tasks efficiently, particularly across multicloud environments.\n“There’s lots of things happening in OpenTelemetry,” said Morgan McLean (pictured), OpenTelemetry co-founder and senior director of product management at Splunk. “I think in the last year or two the adoption of the project has taken off. When we started OpenTelemetry, if you told me it would be as widely used across whole swaths of the market as it is today, I would’ve been a little skeptical that it would be so rapidly adopted. Yet we see major banks, airlines and businesses that are only relatively early in their Kubernetes adoption journey already diving into OTel and adopting it widely, which is very exciting for us.”\nMcLean spoke with theCUBE Research’s Savannah Peterson and Rob Strechay at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed MultiKueue and OpenTelemetry as a step forward in distributed AI and cluster management, signifying the growing demand for solutions that enable workload distribution across diverse and expansive architectures. (* Disclosure below.)\nMultiKueue and OpenTelemetry support observability’s next frontier\nProfiling represents the newest phase in observability innovation, and OpenTelemetry plans to introduce this feature in the coming year. Unlike traditional monitoring, profiling allows teams to examine their applications’ performance at the function level, giving insights into inefficiencies in real time, according to McLean.\n“Everyone knows what logging is, everyone knows what monitoring is, everyone knows what tracing is,” he said. “You talk about profiling, and the only people who sort of know what it is are ones where their bill is on the order of like $50 million a month for compute. That always irked me, and I love working on it. It’s really exciting to me, being able to look at your code and understand which functions within your code are costing you a ton of money is powerful and exciting.”\nWith profiling in OpenTelemetry, organizations of all sizes will soon have the tools to catch inefficiencies without the need for custom-built solutions. For developers, profiling offers an unprecedented view of their code’s impact on resource usage, enabling faster, more cost-effective optimizations, according to McLean.\n“You can profile stuff at development time, but for a large production system, you can never emulate its load properly on a single box, or even run it,” he said. “[Profiling] gives you insights that you have no other way of capturing for real workloads, and you can save tons of money with it.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA:\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA.

        "content": "Thousands of ordinary citizens are already using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques, whether they know it or not.\n\nOnline sleuths attempt to solve crimes by scouring social media posts for clues, and dating app users run potential suitors’ profiles through a reverse image search to verify they are who they say. OSINT—once the preserve of intelligence agencies and law enforcement—is becoming accessible, and artificial intelligence (AI) is powering the change.\n\nOSINT involves analyzing publicly accessible information—such as company records, databases, maps, flight data, satellite imagery, and social media posts—to glean information for intelligence. Its development mirrors technological advancement. “The digital revolution enabled the rise of OSINT,” said Andrew Hammond, a historian at the International Spy Museum in Washington D.C., and host of the SpyCast podcast.\n\nWhile the acronym OSINT is modern, the act of gathering open-source intelligence is much older. During World War II, for example, BBC Monitoring Services and the U.S Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service listened in on radio broadcasts and speeches to monitor enemy activities. “It is a way to build up the picture of the world,” Hammond explained. “At every stage it’s conditioned by the technology, because the technology affects the volume and flow of information, how widely it can be dispersed, how much of it can be dispersed.” The advent of the printing press, radio, and television all increased our ability to collect information but, continued Hammond, the Internet propelled OSINT to a “completely different level.”\n\nThe advent of the Internet not only led intelligence agencies into new digital spheres, it also blew access to information wide open. Companies now use OSINT to glean insights and market intelligence, and organizations like Bellingcat and the non-profit Centre for Information Resilience use open source methods to carry out investigations. In a nod to OSINT’s roots, Bellingcat’s founder, Eliot Higgins, entitled his book about the collective We Are Bellingcat: An Intelligence Agency for the People.\n\nStaggering amounts of data are now publicly accessible, but analyzing it is beyond the scope of traditional OSINT; humans do not have the capacity to comb through billions of tweets, newspapers, document dumps, forums, and speeches. Said Hammond, “There could be information there that can help us, for example, avert a terrorist bombing in London. But how do we find a needle in a haystack? That’s where AI comes in.”\n\nBeyond Human\n\nAI extends OSINT far beyond human capabilities. Terabytes of data now can be scraped from the Web or social media and processed at high speed; security threats can be picked up from online forums using sentiment analysis, and people and places in photos or videos can be identified using geolocation, to name but a few applications.\n\nSarah Cammarata, a London-based OSINT trainer and corporate intelligence analyst, became involved in OSINT when she was working as a defense reporter for Politico and for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. She now uses OSINT to investigate white-collar crime. Cammarata stressed that “Data collected through OSINT techniques is only as powerful as the analysis that comes with it, and strong analysis is what will distinguish one analyst from another.”\n\nShe acknowledges AI-enabled technology has improved her workflow. “It automates lengthy processes like identifying social media accounts related to subjects of interest (SOI). In addition, facial recognition technology, like Pimeyes, significantly helps to find images of SOI or to identify who an individual is.”\n\nIn corporate intelligence investigations, data collection can take days or weeks, said Cammarata. “AI has the ability to allow intel analysts to focus on strategic tasks, like interrogating the data itself to identify reputational and other types of risk.” Multilingual AI also has expanded access to information. “When conducting an investigation in another language, next-generation language models like Deepl make the investigation possible,” said Cammarata.\n\nThree-Legged Stool\n\nKurt Luther is a senior advisor for OSINT at the Virginia Tech National Security Institute; he also directs the university’s Crowd Intelligence Lab. Traditionally, explained Luther, OSINT has been a tedious endeavor. “The best investigators learn some programming so they can automate some of the more tedious tasks. But AI has the potential to not just help with programming, but to perform many of those tasks by itself.”\n\nGenerative AI has made AI more accessible to expert and amateur OSINT practitioners, he said. “There are now custom LLMs that focus on OSINT, Google dorking [advanced search techniques used to find specific or hidden information], pentesting [penetration testing for security purposes], and other closely related topics.”\n\nLuther’s research interests include combating disinformation and misinformation. He explained that there is currently “something of an OSINT arms race” between people who are generating misinformation and those who debunk it. “Bad actors are increasingly using AI to generate and spread misinformation, while OSINT investigators, such as journalists and national security experts, are increasingly leveraging AI and AI-powered tools to speed up or improve the quality of their work.”\n\nAt the Crowd Intelligence Lab, Luther’s team focuses on understanding real-world crowdsourced investigations. Their research includes a study of Sedition Hunters, an open-source community that used OSINT techniques to help the FBI and Capitol Police identify participants in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and a study of social structures in collaborative OSINT investigations.\n\nLuther predicts OSINT will evolve into a “three-legged stool” composed of experts, crowds, and AI—each with complementary strengths. Experts, Luther explained, bring experience, professionalism, and ethical guidance, while AI enables data collection and processing, and “crowds can scale up an investigation by bringing many more people to explore leads in greater breadth and depth, as well as specialized and localized knowledge.”\n\nPitfalls and Possibilities\n\nAI makes OSINT more efficient and accessible; however, challenges remain. Security concerns make Cammarata hesitant to adopt AI in all her work. “It is difficult to decide whether or not to allow a third-party tool to access data that we handle, which is confidential or sensitive. AI-powered third-party tools must be vetted from an information security angle.”\n\nInternational data usage and privacy legislation also needs to be considered. Said Cammarata, “It is vital to ensure you know where data is being hosted by the third party and what their infosec landscape is. Data inputs can also help teach ML technology, so find out if the tool is storing the data to develop its abilities.”\n\nShe flagged AI model bias and integrity as potentially problematic. “On face value, the result may seem perfectly plausible, but it could be factually incorrect. All information retrieved from an LLM must be double- or tripled-verified against other sources. LLMs should not be viewed as silver bullets.”\n\nMany OSINT experts are still figuring out exactly how AI best fits into their workflows. As Luther puts it, “There’s a need for more human-computer interaction and user experience research to understand the needs and existing practices of OSINT researchers in order to design better tools for them.”\n\nYet AI may not make an OSINT expert out of everyone. As Hammond pointed out, from an intelligence agency’s perspective, “That involves particular types of training, particular methodologies.” Yet, easy access to information and the ever-improving capacity of AI to process it now make OSINT techniques increasingly accessible to ordinary citizens—even if they are simply doing some online sleuthing or checking, they are not being catfished.\n\nKaren Emslie is a location-independent freelance journalist and essayist.",

Accel chipped in as well. Tessl earlier raised a $25 million seed investment that was jointly led by boldstart and Alphabet Inc.’s GV startup fund. The company is now reportedly valued at $750 million.\nLondon-based Tessl is developing an AI platform that will make it possible to create software with natural language prompts. According to the company, the plan is enabling users to describe the application they wish to build in a high-level specification. Tessl’s algorithms will automatically turn customers’ specifications into code.\nThe platform will generate Java, JavaScript and Python code on launch. Java powers many enterprise applications, while JavaScript and Python are widely used for web development and AI projects, respectively. Tessl plans to add support for more languages down the line.\nBesides generating software, the platform will also help developers maintain it. According to Tessl, its algorithms will be capable of automatically detecting any performance issues that may emerge in an application over time and fix them. The company also plans to offer features for spotting cybersecurity issues.\nGuy Podjarny, Tessl’s founder and chief executive, previously launched software security specialist Snyk Ltd. The latter startup received a $7.4 billion valuation in its most recent funding round.\nTessl’s software maintenance features won’t be limited to fixing security and performance issues. According to the company, its AI will also be capable of detecting changes in the external components on which a program depends to work.\nEnterprise applications often interact with external services through application programming interfaces, or APIs. An API can change over time as the application to which it provides accessed is updated with new features. When such changes occur, the workloads that rely on the API must be modified as well, a task Tessl hopes to streamline with its platform.\nThe company plans to add support for more use cases over time. According to Tessl, the plan is to equip its platform with the ability to collect telemetry about an application and analyze the data to identify areas for improvement. “Implementations will be customizable, refined to your specific environment based on your data, and enabling dynamic changes like prioritized speed at peak hours vs costs overnight,” Podjarny wrote in a blog post today.\nTessl expects to launch the platform in early 2025. According to the company, it will allow customers to build more sophisticated applications than competing coding assistants. Tessl envisions developers using its platform to build a variety of services including web and mobile apps.\nThe company’s funding milestone comes weeks after Poolside, another startup in the process of building an AI-powered coding platform, disclosed a $500 million raise. It used the capital to build a cluster of 10,000 Nvidia Corp. graphics cards. The chips will enable Poolside to train large language models optimized for coding tasks.\nImage: Unsplash\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Reports suggest that Intel has removed the ability for users to bypass DLVR through the BIOS in its latest 0x112 microcode—per Hardwareluxx. DLVR technology on Intel's Arrow Lake lineup of CPUs is said to improve efficiency, though you could choose not to use the feature through a \"DLVR bypass\" setting in the BIOS in case you were overclocking (OC).\n\nDLVR is not technically an Arrow Lake-first technology. It was also featured on Raptor Lake but fused off for technical reasons. DLVR is a part of the CPU die used to regulate power in tandem with the motherboard's voltage regulators - offering granular control over each performance and efficiency core cluster's voltage.\n\nAs explained by der8auer, DLVR is helpful in gaming loads where a 0.3V delta (between Vin and Vcore) nets a 20W power loss (20W = 0.3V x 67A). However, in production workloads where all cores are in full throttle, a 0.4V delta quickly results in over 88W of power lost (88W = 0.4V x 220A). This is why some motherboards had an option (Power Gate) to bypass DLVR, ultimately offering Raptor Lake-like voltage control.\n\n\"This was done to prevent accidental misuse of DLVR bypass, also known as power gate mode, by ensuring it's only used in extreme overclocking scenarios with sub-ambient cooling such as liquid nitrogen.\" Intel to Hardwareluxx\n\nIt appears that users can no longer switch DLVR off using the Power Gate profile after installing the latest 0x112 microcode for Arrow Lake. On further clarification, Intel says that this setting was removed to prevent \"accidental misuse\" of the feature. The company rep further states that DLVR is meant to be bypassed only in exotic overclocking setups - possibly through the LN2 profile on high-end boards - locking out the average consumer.\n\nMaybe Intel is trying to avoid another Raptor Lake fiasco, but many enthusiasts will argue that the decision should be left to the end-user, at least in the DIY space. From what we can infer, this leaves early Arrow Lake adopters at the mercy of their motherboards since not every board has an extreme overclocking profile.",
        "summary": "Intel has removed the option for users to bypass DLVR technology through the BIOS in its latest 0x112 microcode for Arrow Lake CPUs, aiming to prevent accidental misuse. DLVR, which was also present in Raptor Lake but disabled for technical reasons, helps regulate power efficiently by working with the motherboard's voltage regulators. While DLVR is beneficial for gaming loads, it can lead to significant power loss during full-throttle production workloads, which is why some motherboards previously offered a bypass option. Intel clarified that the DLVR bypass should only be used in extreme overclocking scenarios with sub-ambient cooling, such as liquid nitrogen, and has now restricted this feature to prevent misuse by average consumers. This decision has sparked debate among enthusiasts who believe the choice to bypass DLVR should be left to the end-user, especially in the DIY space, leaving early Arrow Lake adopters dependent on their motherboard's capabilities.",

        "content": "AMD may already have won this generation of desktop processors. But the company is convinced that you should also be turning to Ryzen processors for mobile gaming, as a series of AMD’s own benchmarks show the Ryzen AI 300 absolutely dominating.\n\nAMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the clear-cut winner in terms of desktop gaming. But a new blog post from AMD lays out how well the company believes it compares against Intel’s new Core Ultra 200 — the “Lunar Lake” processor — in terms of mobile gaming. AMD also didn’t hesitate to point out that its own HYPR-RX and FSR technologies give it a leg up over Intel’s XeSS, which only appears in a few games.\n\nTo be fair, Intel’s Lunar Lake is in the crosshairs of both the power-sipping Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite — which it attempted to emulate by reducing power and performance — and AMD’s own Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. AMD’s gaming positioning basically echoed our own Ryzen AI 300 conclusions: Lunar Lake and the Snapdragon go head-to-head in terms of power draw and performance. AMD’s Ryzen, on the other hand, is embracing what it should: as a mobile hot rod.\n\nAMD presented several benchmarks that obviously cast it in the best light. Still, some of the comparisons are pretty damning: In Forza Horizon 5, for example, AMD said it can achieve 135 frames per second at 1080p resolution, at Medium settings. That’s double the 68 fps that the Core Ultra 7 285V can achieve, the company said. (Head-to-head, the actual comparison was dead even; the additional frames came from AMD’s HYPR-RX technology.) AMD launched what it called Hyper-RX in 2023, turning on a number of frame enhancement technologies all in one go. AMD’s point is that HYPR-RX is available in “thousands” of games, while Intel’s comparable XeSS, well, isn’t.\n\nAMD’s own Ryzen AI HX 300 benchmarks with its frame-enhancement techniques factored in… AMD\n\nHowever, AMD also came armed with benchmarks that show that the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 simply whomps Lunar Lake in straight head-to-head comparisons, too. In the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, AMD says a laptop equipped with its Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 can hit 99 fps at 1080p Medium settings, versus a subpar 48 fps for the Core Ultra 7 258V.\n\nAll of the tests were performed without a dedicated, discrete GPU providing assistance, on similar Asus ZenBook laptops. AMD did have a slight advantage, potentially, as its configuration was inside a 16-inch ZenBook. Intel’s chip was inside a 14-inch version.\n\nIn total, AMD is claiming an average of 75 percent faster performance with its chip compared to Lunar Lake. It’s an interesting claim, as a study by Tom’s Hardware comes to the opposite conclusion: that Intel’s integrated GPU, part of the processor itself, is actually faster.\n\n…and without. AMD’s new Ryzen AI 300 chips show massive gains, straight up. AMD\n\nThe subtext to all of this? As we head into the holiday season, AMD would obviously like to steal some of Intel’s market share in the mobile space, even as its desktop chips showed strong year-over-year growth.\n\nBut we also know that Intel plans to launch the Arrow Lake-HX and Arrow Lake-H chips for gaming laptops early in 2025, and most likely at CES. AMD obviously hopes to take the wind out of Intel’s, er, sales before the chips even leave port.",

By integrating observability into cloud systems, companies can not only enhance operational efficiency, but also harness AI’s potential to provide resilient, seamless services in a high-demand market, according to Priscyla Laham (pictured, right), vice president of ISV partnerships, Americas, at Microsoft Corp.\n“I see observability as mission-critical,” Laham said. “It’s really mission-critical in a world where you have the clouds and all the benefits that the enterprise really wants from the cloud, improving efficiency, improving adaptability, flexibility, accelerating the innovation, all of those benefits. Observability comes to this scenario to help companies to improve on that. To monitor, to prevent issues before [they] get to the users, to prevent from threats. With the advanced analytics that we see in anomaly detection that we have on [the] Dynatrace observability platform, you can have this benefit.”\nLaham and Jay Snyder (left), senior vice president of partners and alliances at Dynatrace LLC, spoke with theCUBE Research’s Bob Laliberte, for an exclusive interview on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio, on the topic of “Next-Gen Observability to Ensure Business Resiliency.” They discussed how cloud observability has become essential for business resilience, allowing enterprises to harness real-time insights, improve security and increase operational efficiency in complex digital and hybrid environments by leveraging advanced analytics and AI capabilities. (* Disclosure below.)\nMission-critical cloud observability for business resilience\nCloud environments are increasingly hybrid, with applications, data and infrastructure distributed across various locations. Traditional methods of monitoring and managing these environments are now insufficient, as highlighted by the growing need for observability — a technology providing continuous, real-time insights into system performance. A perfect example of this is Dynatrace’s partnership with Aeroporti di Roma, an airport in Rome according to Snyder.\n“We partnered with them to achieve three major outcomes. One was unparalleled travel experience, the second was improved operational efficiency and the third was factor vulnerability detection,” he explained. “For many of these instances, ADR has been able to use AI capabilities to create automated workflows that enable applications to self-heal without the need for any human intervention.”\nBeyond efficiency, cloud observability enhances security, a crucial aspect in today’s digitally connected world where threats evolve rapidly. The observability platform in use by ADR alerts the airport to any new vulnerabilities, prioritizes them based on potential impact, and, in some cases, allows applications to self-heal without human intervention. This automated approach to security management aligns with a growing industry need for tools that can identify and address threats in real-time, ensuring business continuity without interrupting service.\n“When I say safely, I’m talking about application security built right into the platform to ensure as you build, deploy and iterate, you are not exposed or will be exposed to the myriads of vulnerabilities that exist today,” Snyder said. “When you add cloud plus observability, it equals business outcomes through digital transformation at pace and in the most secure way possible. This is what we mean when we talk about resilient businesses. One that can iterate, operate and innovate at light speed anywhere with the knowledge to know that what you are doing, where you are doing it, and when something goes wrong, it’s fixed in seconds.”\nDriving business transformation with AI and cloud observability\nThe shift to cloud-based observability solutions also supports the accelerated adoption of AI. In enterprise environments, AI is increasingly recognized as a tool for business transformation, optimizing everything from employee productivity to customer engagement. Integrating AI with observability empowers companies to gain insights faster and make data-driven decisions. Real-time data analysis, driven by advanced machine learning, not only identifies potential disruptions, but also highlights operational patterns, helping organizations improve and streamline their services.\n“Customers are embracing AI even faster, and for sure cloud is like a basics for all the evolution and all the innovation you can get from AI,” Laham said. “We are seeing a big wave of adoption testing, piloting and executing. We have a lot of customers already taking the ROI, the return on investment for the AI, the way that they are using AI. I like to say that on the AI discussion, there is a lot of excitement with the technology, but we say to our customers that you have to have a business transformation first mindset. Technology is an enabler for your business transformation.”\nCloud providers and observability companies are working closely to meet the demands of these increasingly sophisticated environments. By developing and refining tools together, they enable enterprises to achieve faster time-to-value, seamlessly integrate security and improve the overall customer experience.\n“It’s not just about being first to market, but about how you monetize that gold of today, which is the data,” Snyder said. “In this AI and automation driven world, we collectively can enhance and enrich that data being generated in the cloud, allowing our customers to benefit to make real-time business decisions … I can tell you behind the scenes, there’s a tremendous amount of work that goes into the technology roadmap and the collaboration that we put forward to make sure, again, always designing from the customer back.”\nHere’s theCUBE’s complete video interview with Jay Snyder and Priscyla Laham:\n(* Disclosure: Dynatrace LLC and Microsoft Corp. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "Image Credit NewsNation / YouTube\n\nWarhawk and former National Security Adviser John Bolton asked the deep state on Wednesday to deep-six former Hawaii Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz because their nominations to President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet threaten the establishment.\n\nTrump tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general and Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence. The picks triggered a meltdown from members of the deep state, including Bolton, who told NewsNation on Wednesday that the FBI should be weaponized to investigate Gaetz and Gabbard in order to “send a message to China that the U.S. is serious about its national security.”\n\n“I don’t think either [Gabbard] or Matt Gaetz ought to have a confirmation hearing until they have both had full-field FBI investigations,” Bolton said. “And then I think the Chinese would say, ‘Maybe they are serious.’”\n\n“With [Trump’s] announcement of Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence, he’s sending a signal that we have lost our mind when it comes to collecting intelligence,” Bolton said. Notably, China managed to fly several spy balloons over the United States under the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n“Given the Russian propaganda that she has espoused over the past period of time, I think [Gabbard] is a serious threat to our national security,” Bolton said.\n\nGaetz and Gabbard aren’t strangers to deep-state corruption. Gabbard recently found herself on a Transportation Security Administration watchlist for enhanced surveillance, a whistleblower alleged. Gabbard was reportedly surveilled by federal air marshals on at least eight separate flights after she criticized President Joe Biden in a Fox News appearance.\n\nGaetz was targeted by the deep state in 2021 after an anonymously sourced report from The New York Times accused him of potentially being a child sex trafficker. The story came after Gaetz helped defeat the Russia-collusion hoax perpetrated by radical leftists, criticized the media for their biased coverage of the Black Lives Matter riots, and highlighted the Justice Department’s weaponized actions.\n\nAfter 18 months of the propaganda press tarnishing Gaetz’s reputation for allegedly being a pedophile, The Washington Post (in another anonymously sourced report) said prosecutors would not recommend charges for Gaetz.\n\nIn simpler terms, the deep-state manufactured a damning story, let it ruminate in the public square for more than a year, and then announced no charges would be brought because there was no evidence. But as The Federalist’s Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway wrote: “Gaetz couldn’t very well critique the Department of Justice for their political prosecutions if he was a pariah who everyone thought was a pedophile.”\n\nAnd now, Bolton wants the Biden-Harris administration to use its remaining weeks in power to sic the FBI on political dissidents all because they threaten to dismantle the intelligence state.\n\nBrianna Lyman is an elections correspondent at The Federalist.

        "content": "The 51 former intelligence officials who suggested Hunter Biden’s laptop was Russian disinformation could lose their security clearances, Republican lawmakers indicated this week.\n\nThe potential action of revoking the security clearances would fulfill a campaign pledge by Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. “You cannot lie, take your position of public trust, and lie to the American people for political purposes,” Vance said. “It’s disgraceful. And people have to suffer consequences for it.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has not indicated if he will bring a measure to the House floor to fulfill the campaign promise. President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide victory fueled Republicans maintaining the House majority and Johnson’s job as Speaker.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, however, voiced support this week for revoking the clearances.\n\n“I think we should scrub all the legacy clearances to see whether the people need to have them and for what purpose, and unless they’re working for a company in a role that makes sense, they should be taken away,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) told the Washington Times. “Most on that list [of 51], I would include in that scrubbing.”\n\nThe 51 intelligence officials “should all lose their security clearances,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) told the paper.\n\nTrump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said “it should be an option.”\n\nAfter the “laptop from hell” story broke before the 2020 election, 51 intel officials signed a letter that insinuated Hunter’s laptop was Russian disinformation. The letter was peddled by Politico under the title, “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.” Most establishment media organizations then used the Politico article to discount the revelations from the laptop.\n\nPresident Joe Biden cited the story during a 2020 presidential debate with Trump to discredit the laptop’s contents. The story was reportedly planted by Secretary of State Antony Blinken for Biden to use during the event.\n\nThe 51 signatories, however, seemingly knew the Politico story was false at the time because the FBI had the laptop that Hunter abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop. Apparently not a single one of the signatories of the infamous letter have retracted their made-up claim, Breitbart News reported in June.\n\nBelow are the 51 intel officers, who sometimes double as CNN and MSNBC media analysts:\n\nJim Clapper Mike Hayden Leon Panetta John Brennan Thomas Finger Rick Ledgett John McLaughlin Michael Morell Mike Vickers Doug Wise Nick Rasmussen Russ Travers Andy Liepman John Moseman Larry Pfeiffer Jeremy Bash Rodney Snyder Glenn Gerstell David B.

        "summary": "Republican lawmakers are considering revoking the security clearances of 51 former intelligence officials who suggested that Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation. This action aligns with a campaign promise by Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, who criticized the officials for allegedly misleading the public for political reasons. House Speaker Mike Johnson has not yet decided whether to bring this measure to the House floor, but several Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Darrell Issa and Rep. Andy Biggs, have expressed support for revoking the clearances. The controversy stems from a letter signed by these officials before the 2020 election, which was used to discredit the laptop's contents, despite the FBI reportedly having the laptop in their possession. The officials have not retracted their claims, and the list includes individuals who also serve as media analysts for CNN and MSNBC.",

        "content": "Dynatrace leans into trusted reputation with data observability platform\nAdopting generative artificial intelligence in a secure way can be a difficult journey for many customers, with data observability being a crucial factor in monitoring AI models.\nDynatrace LLC has deep roots in data observability, driving AI advancements with its OpenTelemetry (OTel) observability project and Davis CoPilot, an AI engine for increasing productivity. However, gen AI is not an all-in-one solution, according to Michael Winkler (pictured), senior director of product management at Dynatrace.\n“[Gen AI]’s not this magic tool that you have and it does all the work for you,” he said. “It’s a productivity boost. There was a discussion a few weeks back also from Google that said 25% of their code is already generated by AI, but a lot of it is around auto-completing methods … this is what we see ourselves, as well, as we apply Davis CoPilot, how customers use it. It’s a productivity boost. It’s not this magic thing that solves everything for you, but it makes you smarter and more productive.”\nWinkler spoke with theCUBE Research’s Savannah Peterson and Rob Strechay at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed data observability, why security is making a comeback and Dynatrace’s AI strategy. (* Disclosure below.)\nMerging security and data observability\nWith OTel, Dynatrace aims to enable all of its customers to track and secure their data. The tool provides automatic insights on user data which can be especially useful for managing AI models.\n“We try to make ingest[ion] of data into Dynatrace as simple as possible,” Winkler said. “No one brings in data for the sake of bringing in data. Where we see the biggest advantage of the easy button of Dynatrace is that we provide answers and opinionated feedback automatically. Not everyone is a subject matter expert in observability, but they still need to understand what they see.”\nDynatrace’s Davis AI has a Kubernetes monitoring solution so that customers can receive alerts from Davis about warning events in their system. Winkler is heartened to see security make a comeback in the AI space.\n“I was in Chicago and Amsterdam [KubeCons], and if you looked at the taglines of the different vendors and at the different booths, there was all AI and automation observability, but there was not so much security,” he said. “I hope or believe that maybe security is back because platform engineering makes it more easier to adopt. It’s not an afterthought. It’s not a different department.”\nDynatrace is confident that its long history in data observability will carry it through this period of AI adoption. A trustworthy stream of information is essential for maintaining a long relationship with customers, Winkler emphasized.\n“We’ve been doing it for so long that our customers trust our Davis A,I because they know that we have a good root cause analysis,” he said. “They know that we can pinpoint what the problems really are.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA:\n(* Disclosure: Dynatrace LLC sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "From security challenges to AI workflows: Open-source ecosystems fuel integration and innovation across industries\nOpen-source projects are no longer just tools for developers — they’ve become the backbone of transformative ecosystems driving progress in artificial intelligence, security and platform engineering.\nAs industries pivot toward integrated solutions, the spotlight is on interoperability, enhanced developer experiences and reducing complexity. This shift underscores a collective push for workflows and standards that champion sustainable innovation over temporary fixes, according to Taylor Dolezal (pictured), head of ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\n“I think that’s the best advice that we can give people is … don’t bind to the project, bind to the workflow,” Dolezal said. “It’s things like Wasm and other stuff are also coming up, and so that’s interesting to see these little places where this used to be infrastructure for a long time. Kubernetes was pretty much it, and then when that slowed down and became stable — and we’re still doing that day over day — we saw the contributions start to go down. If you looked at the CNCF as a whole, it’s still up and to the right … we just slow down with some of the old problem spaces and then we get to focus on these new ones. At the end of the road [there] are only more roads. It’s never going to stop.”\nDolezal spoke with theCUBE Research’s Rob Strechay and Savannah Peterson at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the evolution of open-source projects, such as Kubernetes, into critical ecosystems driving innovation in AI, security and platform engineering while emphasizing collaboration, interoperability and sustainable workflows. (* Disclosure below.)\nOpen-source projects drive innovation and collaboration\nDuring the 10-year celebration of Kubernetes, discussions within the open-source community have highlighted how the platform has grown into a critical infrastructure hub. Its influence extends far beyond traditional use cases, drawing developers from diverse fields into an ecosystem that promotes collaboration and innovation, according to Dolezal.\n“I’m seeing a lot of developers come into the fray … this used to just be a whole bunch of infrastructure people,” he said. “Now, we’re seeing all these different fields converge, because Kubernetes and all of these other projects are proliferating so much.”\nOne standout insight from the community is the continued emphasis on security. As complexity grows, end users have identified security as a primary challenge, prompting initiatives, such as the Open Source Security Foundation, to address these concerns.\n“We’re starting to say this is really tiring, let’s slow down, let’s establish some standards or agree on what makes sense for all of us and go a little bit slower,” Dolezal said. “That’s when you see the cross communication really start to happen, stability takes over. I’m guessing that’s what we’re going to see over the coming months is just … [a] little bit more nuance, a little bit more stoic approach to AI.”\nLooking ahead, the industry aims to simplify Kubernetes further, making it less visible as a technology and more integral as an enabler. This vision aligns with a broader trend toward standardization and stability, reducing fragmentation across ecosystems. As one expert noted, this approach allows for meaningful collaboration and a focus on creating “cool things” rather than reinventing the wheel, according to Dolezal.\n“I think Kubernetes is still going to be viable for a long time,” he said. “I am hoping it’s going to fade into the background a little bit more on that front … that bounce back I think is going to happen again, especially with GPUs and things like that. Using a service is going to make sense until we can commoditize that and push that back to people at the edge.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA:\n(* Disclosure: The Cloud Native Computing Foundation sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "AI agents are on the march, but will they justify the endless big spending on AI?\nAgentic artificial intelligence, the notion of AI agents that can semiautonomously conduct a series of tasks without much human involvement, gained even more momentum this week, as OpenAI said its Operator agent is coming in January.\nDavid Linthicum tells us what else is coming in agentic AI, though it’s also worth pointing out that it’s mostly talk at this point and there are lots of process, security and other challenges to deal with before the world runs on AI agents. As Warren Barkley, head of product for Google’s Vertex AI, gen AI and machine learning, noted at Palo Alto Networks’ Ignite event Thursday, “It’s a cool buzzword. Eventually some of those orchestrations will show up, but it’s super-early for that.”\nDespite widespread worries that AI and big-data spending is getting out of hand, that wasn’t an issue this past week. Elon Musk’s xAI is looking to raise $6 billion, CoreWeave got a big slug from Cisco, Pure Storage and others, Databricks may get an additional $1 billion, and Writer reeled in $200 million more. But valuations may be cooling.\nAI was also not surprisingly the big topic at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Salt Lake City, including new services from Red Hat, Google and others.\nBroadcom paid a lot for VMware, and its loss of customers as a result of changes in licensing and offerings has gotten a lot of attention, not just from customers but competitors smelling an opportunity. But theCUBE Research Chief Analyst Dave Vellante thinks Broadcom and its customers will actually benefit more than most people realize.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is cutting 4% of its staff but it says it’s doing so to double down on the AI opportunity, though that’s a positive spin that warrants some skepticism as the Nvidia freight train doesn’t seem to be slowing down.\nMeantime, Cisco Systems is still struggling to restore revenue growth despite early signs that it’s getting some traction for its AI data center hardware. Lenovo got an AI boost, and so did Applied Materials, but its challenges in China depressed its outlook, and investors.\nThe home of the CEO of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan, whose prediction market that correctly called the election for Donald Trump, was raided by the FBI amid allegations that it illegally let U.S. citizens participate in betting. He charged it was retaliation, but that seems less likely than that Polymarket was a little careless.\nThe Federal Trade Commission is reportedly probing Microsoft’s cloud practices for anticompetitive behavior, but it’s unclear whether the new presidential administration will cheer or jeer the case.\nNext week there’s the big earnings kahuna — Nvidia, the most valuable public company in the world — plus Snowflake, Palo Alto Networks, NetApp and Elastic. On the event front, there’s SC24, the high-performance computing conference. TheCUBE and theCUBE Research will be onsite for interviews and analysis and SiliconANGLE will have the news. There’s also Microsoft Ignite, for which we’ll have all the news.\nThis and other news will be discussed by Vellante and John Furrier in this week’s theCUBE Pod, out this afternoon on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, coming this weekend for an analysis of the latest cloud computing market data.\nHere’s this week’s top news and analysis from

        "content": "While Linux 6.12 should be out this weekend with its many exciting features , following that will mark the start of the Linux 6.13 kernel cycle with what will be the first stable kernel release of 2025... Already there is a lot of exciting feature work expected to land during the Linux 6.13 merge window.Based on my monitoring of the various \"-next\" branches, below is a look at some of the features expected to be submitted for the imminent Linux 6.13 merge window. Of course, there could always be last minute changes or objections by Linus Torvalds if he spots any questionable code, but in any event below is a look at some of what's on the table for this next kernel version.\n\nLinux 6.13 brings several new features for AMD EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors / Zen 5 as well as the 3D V-Cache Optimizer for exciting Ryzen users, Intel Panther Lake enablement is beginning to heat up, PREEMPT_LAZY is expected, support for more older Apple devices on the mainline Linux kernel, the ReiserFS file-system is set to be sunset, and more: The AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver is set to be merged. The AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver allows for Linux users on Ryzen X3D CPUs where only one of the CCDs has a larger L3 cache can communicate their preference whether they want the cores with the larger cache to have priority or the frequency mode where the cores of the other CCD take priority. AMD Heterogeneous CPU Design Topology patches have been queued up ahead of Linux 6.13. PCIe TPH for TLB Processing Hints as one of the new features with AMD EPYC 9005 series processors.- Another notable change for Linux 6.13 when it comes to AMD EPYC 9005 series processors is defaulting to using the AMD P-State driver for EPYC Turin rather than the ACPI CPUFreq driver as the former default. Initial work on the Intel Xe3 next-generation graphics support with an initial focus on the integrated graphics to be found with Panther Lake processors. Intel GPU temperature reporting support is finally landing... Intel OA sync support and PXP GuC auto-teardown functionality. Intel PCIe cooling driver is set to be finally merged. PREEMPT_LAZY support is expected to be merged. Arm Guarded Control Stack support for the kernel. Big/super page support for the Raspberry Pi graphics driver to yield better performance. Basic support for a number of pre-M1 Apple devices on the mainline Linux kernel with A-series silicon and various iPhone/iPad devices. Better default/out-of-the-box tuning for Intel Xeon Granite Rapids processors with their EPP powersave value. NVIDIA Mellanox MLX5 DDP support for Data Direct Placement to boost bandwidth performance.Stay tuned for the Phoronix coverage during the Linux 6.13 merge window to see what other features/changes land over the next two weeks. Following that, it's on to the exciting Linux 6.13 kernel performance benchmarking.",
        "summary": "The Linux 6.13 kernel cycle is set to begin soon, introducing several new features and improvements. Key updates include enhancements for AMD EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors and Zen 5, such as the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver and AMD Heterogeneous CPU Design Topology patches. Intel's Panther Lake processors will see initial support, including Intel GPU temperature reporting and PCIe cooling driver integration. The kernel will also support more older Apple devices, improve Raspberry Pi graphics performance, and offer better tuning for Intel Xeon Granite Rapids processors. Additionally, the ReiserFS file system is being phased out, and NVIDIA Mellanox MLX5 DDP support is being added to enhance bandwidth performance.",

        "content": "Yesterday, Donald Trump named former Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as his Director of National Intelligence.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the announcement, the liberal media is already trying to smear Gabbard as a conspirator in some sort of imaginary plot.\n\nI was stunned to see this, but in retrospect, I should not have been. These people are evil.\n\nFrom NBC News:\n\nTrump’s pick for top intel job has been accused of ‘traitorous’ parroting of Russian propaganda President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence, former Democratic lawmaker Tulsi Gabbard, has been accused of amplifying Russian propaganda and would come to the job having never worked in the intelligence world or served on a congressional intelligence committee. Gabbard, who served in the Hawaii Army National Guard and was deployed to Iraq with a medical unit, has long criticized U.S. foreign policy as imperial and heavy-handed. She also has sharply criticized Trump in the past over his approach to the Middle East during his first presidential term, portraying him as dangerous. As director of national intelligence, a position created in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Gabbard would oversee 18 intelligence agencies with a budget of about $70 billion and serve as the principal adviser to the president on intelligence matters. She would first need to be confirmed by the Senate, where Republicans will hold the majority starting in January. In her public statements, Gabbard has often been at odds with the U.S. intelligence community’s assessments. If she is confirmed, her tenure would most likely be marked by clashes with government analysts who see Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government as the primary purveyor of disinformation designed to sow divisions in the U.S.\n\nRussia! Russia! Russia!\n\nPutin! Putin! Putin!\n\nDo you get the ridiculous game these people are playing yet?\n\nThis is not about Russia or Putin. It’s about discrediting Trump’s nomination of a former Democrat to his cabinet. Tulsi Gabbard is a Trump convert and the media can’t have that.\n\nJohn Bolton, king of the Neocons, is already demanding a deep state style investigation.\n\nJohn Bolton Calls on FBI To Investigate Trump Nominees Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard: ‘A Serious Threat to Our National Security’ https://t.co/1VKGP0uQsg — Mediaite (@Mediaite) November 14, 2024\n\nFrom Mediaite:\n\nJohn Bolton Calls on FBI To Investigate Trump Nominees Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard: ‘A Serious Threat to Our National Security’ Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton urged the FBI to investigate Matt Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard after President-elect Donald Trump nominated them to serve as attorney general and director of national intelligence, respectively, on Wednesday. During an appearance on NewsNation’s The Hill, Bolton said: With his announcement of Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence, he’s sending a signal that we have lost our mind when it comes to collecting intelligence. This is, up until a few hours ago, I would have said that was the worst cabinet appointment in recent American history. Of course, since Matt Gaetz’s nomination, he clearly has taken the lead on that score, but it’s not indication that the administration is serious about one of the most important aspects we’re dealing with.\n\nAt some point, you just have to lean back, point at these idiots, and laugh.\n\nDonations tax deductible\n\nto the full extent allowed by law.",

        "content": "Intel has hinted at plans for a tiled cache design, similar to 3D V-Cache, but not for the desktop gaming segment.\n\nIntel Isn't Influenced By The Success of AMD's \"X3D\" Processors, Says That They Have Limited Audience But Also Plans Introducing Dedicated Cache Tiles For Workstation/Server Segment\n\nAMD's \"X3D\" processors with dedicated 3D V-Cache are by far one of the best CPU options for high-end gaming and productivity workloads, since the extra \"cache tile\" really elevates the overall performance.\n\nTeam Red's newest Ryzen 7 9800X3D \"3D V-Cache\" processor has seen significant sales traction and has even run out across major retailers due to the value brought in by the SKU. However, despite AMD's success, Intel doesn't plan on having a similar desktop CPU anytime soon, as the firm believes that the \"X3D\" CPUs have a minimal target audience.\n\nThis statement was given by Intel's Tech Communications Manager, Florian Maislinger, in an interview with the famous overclocked Der8auer and Bens Hardware. Here's exactly what Maislinger had to say:\n\nThe AMD CPUs are tailored to a very specific target group and that is gamers. We are aware that this technology can bring a lot to gamers, but that always comes with certain drawbacks and certain disadvantages and compromises that you have to make. In this case, it is good if I have an X3D CPU, which may not be as strong in applications. We are aware of this and we still have it technologically. That means that next year there will be a CPU for the first time that has a cache tile, but not in the desktop. (...) In the server, it is simply a different market and a different market breadth that can potentially be addressed than with desktop CPUs. - via HardwareLuxx (Translated)\n\nThere's no doubt about the fact that additional cache in the form of \"3D V-Cache\" has significantly benefited AMD when it comes to bringing in extra performance onboard. Especially with the debut of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Team Red has managed to fill in the \"performance gap\" that the market assumed was to be made by Intel's latest Core Ultra 200 CPUs, but unfortunately, Intel didn't deliver on expectations, at least in the consumer segment.\n\nTeam Blue has plans for a dedicated cache tile for its server and workstation CPUs, but it isn't certain which lineup will get the additional tile. A likely contender is next-gen Clearwater Forest SKUs, but we haven't seen any mention of a dedicated cache tile in previous leaks; hence, it isn't certain for now. Intel did push the cache counts up significantly with its Emerald Rapids chips & Granite Rapids also delivered similar bumps.\n\nThe desktop side has also seen cache upgrades but not as significant as AMD's \"X3D\" lineup. Pat Gelsinger did highlight a stacked cache on future CPUs, but it looks like mainstream desktop CPUs will have to wait till the blue team realizes its potential for gamers.\n\nProducts mentioned in this post AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D USD 679.99",
        "summary": "Intel is considering a tiled cache design similar to AMD's 3D V-Cache but plans to implement it in the workstation and server segments rather than desktop gaming. Despite the success of AMD's \"X3D\" processors, which have become popular for high-end gaming and productivity due to their enhanced performance, Intel believes these CPUs cater to a limited audience. Intel's Tech Communications Manager, Florian Maislinger, stated that while the technology benefits gamers, it comes with certain compromises, and Intel plans to introduce cache tiles in server CPUs next year. Intel's future plans include increasing cache in server and workstation CPUs, with potential candidates being the next-gen Clearwater Forest SKUs, although details remain uncertain. While Intel has made some cache improvements in desktop CPUs, they are not as significant as AMD's advancements, and mainstream desktop CPUs may have to wait for further developments.",

        "content": "Clearwater Forest is turning out to be an entirely different beast. It will incorporate not only the latest goods from Intel Foundry—like Foveros Direct 3D, RibbonFET, PowerVia, and EMIB 3.5D—but also 3D cache, which Intel calls \"Local Cache,\" per an interview with Intel's Florian Maislinger conducted by der8auer and Bens Hardware. And sadly, Team Blue has no plans to introduce AMD 3D V-cache-esque capabilities in its desktop CPUs.\n\nIntel's next-generation E-Core, a Xeon-only series codenamed \"Clearwater Forest,\" will leverage the flagship 18A node on which Pat Gelsinger has staked the entire company's future. Clearwater Forest is expected to use Atom Darkmont cores, succeeding the already-fast Skymont featured in Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake CPUs.\n\nFrom an architectural and packaging standpoint, Clearwater Forest uses three \"active\" Base tiles - each hosting four CPU chiplets or tiles for 12 CPU tiles connected via Hybrid Bonding (Foveros 3D Direct). On the outskirts lie two I/O chiplets - connected to the CPU tiles through EMIB 3.5D. The entire package is expected to feature almost 300 billion transistors.\n\n(Image credit: Intel via SemiWiki\n\n\"For us, [gaming] is not an extremely large mass market,\" Maslinger said. \"We sell a lot of CPUs that are not necessarily used for gaming. We still have [3D Stacked Cache] technologically. This means that next year there will be a CPU [Clearwater Forest] for the first time that has a cache tile, but not on desktop.\"\n\nThe interview confirms something we've missed: how the cache is structured. A quick look at Intel's white paper clarifies that the SRAM is packaged into the Base tile, which Intel calls \"Local Cache.\" Until now, even with a disaggregated design, Intel has employed \"Compute Tiles\" featuring all cores alongside their respective caches linked via the Ring Bus. Clearwater Forest shifts the cache to the Base tile beneath the CPU chiplets, which now only hosts the CPU cores—and the entire assembly acts as a \"Compute Module.\" This is unlike AMD's X3D approach, since the CPU chiplets are mutually dependent on the Base tile.\n\nAfterward, Maislinger asserted that Intel's gaming market is relatively small, and designing an X3D competitor would be pointless if it could not be reused for servers. On a side note, AMD is also looking to introduce 3D V-Cache in Threadrippers.\n\nThe conversation shows that Intel (or rather Intel Foundry) does have the technology to combat AMD's 3D V-Cache: Clearwater Forest. But it isn't planning to make that technology mainstream anytime soon.",
        "summary": "Clearwater Forest is Intel's next-generation E-Core series, designed exclusively for Xeon processors, and will utilize the advanced 18A node technology. It incorporates cutting-edge features like Foveros Direct 3D, RibbonFET, PowerVia, EMIB 3.5D, and a new \"Local Cache\" system, but will not include AMD-like 3D V-cache capabilities for desktop CPUs. The architecture involves three active Base tiles with 12 CPU tiles connected via Hybrid Bonding, and two I/O chiplets linked through EMIB 3.5D, totaling nearly 300 billion transistors. Intel's design shifts the cache to the Base tile, differing from AMD's X3D approach, as the CPU chiplets depend on the Base tile for cache access. Despite having the technology to rival AMD's 3D V-Cache, Intel does not plan to make it widely available, focusing instead on non-gaming markets.",

        "content": "You don’t have to travel abroad to realize, that try as New York has to level up its dining options with chef partnerships, our airport food is seriously lacking, and, not to mention incredibly expensive. Unfortunately, the cost is only going to go up in 2025. A proposed rule affecting airports like LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark would allow their restaurants to raise prices by around an estimated 7.5 percent starting in 2025 (including a built-in quality of life surcharge), to pass rising labor costs to customers. A New York Times report puts it in plain terms: Bobby Van’s Steakhouse at JFK charges $29.50 for a (mind you, not very good) burger and $17 for a glass of chardonnay; starting next year the cost of the combo could be around four bucks more, at nearly $50 before tip. That price won’t be going into improving the quality of the food. Meanwhile, airports have been courting big-name chefs: David Chang is working on opening a new food stand called Peach Palace at JFK, while José Andrés has a restaurant lounge in the works at LGA.\n\nTwo new wine shops have opened\n\nThe owners of the lively Bed-Stuy natural wine bar with a pool table, Frog have opened Frog Wine Shop a couple of miles away in Brooklyn Heights at 389 Henry Street, near Warren Street. Meanwhile, across the bridge, at 83 Henry Street in Manhattan’s Chinatown, Magazzino is another new bottle shop by owners Christina Suarez and Elizabeth Nattinger. It replaced a previous wine shop tenant Leisir.\n\nSohla El-Waylly debuts lunch in the East Village\n\nRecipe developer and chef Sohla El-Waylly is offering a couple of dishes from her cookbook Start Here on the lunch menu of Hearth, a longtime Tuscan East Village staple, including her quinoa salad and brownies. Hearth is located at 403 E. 12th Street, at First Avenue; lunch is served Monday through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The partnership runs through the end of the month.\n\nTop Chef alum opens a Midtown establishment\n\nEd Cotton, who was a runner-up in the finals of Bravo’s Top Chef season 7, and worked in the kitchens of Daniel Boulud, Laurent Tourondel, and David Burke before opening Jack & Charlie’s No.118 in the West Village, unveiled Leonetta earlier this week at 181 Lexington Avenue, in Murray Hill. The restaurant, designed to feel like a seaside villa, will focus on shareable small plates and spreads, a raw bar, pastas, and charcoal-grilled seafood and meats. Among the highlights are black truffle mafaldine, crispy pork shank shawarma, and grilled branzino. — Beth Landman, contributor",

        "content": "Posted in: Disney+, Movies, TV | Tagged: black panther, eyes of wakanda, mcu\nEyes of Wakanda: Marvel Animation Confirms Voice Cast; Image, Overview\nMarvel Animation confirmed the impressive voice cast for \"Black Panther\" series Eyes of Wakanda and included an official image and overview.\nAs we inch closer to 2025, Marvel Studios (via Marvel Television and Marvel Animation) has been rolling out more and more intel on the live-action and animated shows that are set to hit Disney+ screens between now and the end of next year. One of those shows has been the highly anticipated \"Black Panther\" series, Eyes of Wakanda. With the animated series set to hit screens on August 6, 2025, we have an official image and overview to pass along. But first, we thought you might like to know whose voices you will be hearing, so here's a look at the impressive lineup of talent taking part in the epic series: Winnie Harlow, Cress Williams, Patricia Belcher, Larry Herron, Adam Gold, Lynn Whitfield, Jacques Colimon, Jona Xiao, Isaac Robinson-Smith, Gary Anthony Williams, Zeke Alton, Steve Toussaint, and Anika Noni Rose.\nMarvel Animation's new action-adventure series \"Eyes of Wakanda\" follows the adventures of brave Wakandan warriors throughout history. In this globe-trotting adventure, the heroes must carry out dangerous missions to retrieve Vibranium artifacts from the enemies of Wakanda. They are the Hatut Zaraze, and this is their story.\nDisney+ and Marvel Animation's Eyes of Wakanda is directed by Todd Harris and executive-produced by Ryan Coogler. The show is also executive produced by Brad Winderbaum, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt, and Proximity Media's Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian, and Kalia King.\nEyes of Wakanda: Details Released Disney's D23\nDuring Disney's D23 fan expo, expectations were high regarding getting a better look at what's to come on the animation side of things from Marvel Studios (and when it might hit our screens). After a sizzle reel previewing what's to come from Marvel's animation universe, Winderbaum, Marvel Studios' Head of Streaming, Television and Animation, was joined by Coogler and series developer Harris to discuss the series. Coogler and Harris teased that the action sequences are great, with many noting the \"Marvel Gundam\" vibe in what was screened. Harris noted that Coogler built a great framework to build back from when establishing Wakandan history and how it relates to the MCU.\nEach episode of the series takes place at very specific time periods and the opportunity comes from being able to explore so many different intersection points with the greater MCU. The duo also discussed exploring how Wakanda is its own little pocket of Eden while also showing those who paid the price throughout history to maintain the secrecy of Wakanda – and that will include meeting some newcomers. Viewers can look forward to seeing an Iron Fist – and Coogler wants everyone to know that \"everyone in Wakanda gets a six-pack.\" From an artistic style standpoint, Harris shared that Marvel appreciates hand-drawn art, and that is where the style of the series comes from.",

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Enterprise platform engineers must quickly get up to speed in LLMOps -- the next phase of generative AI depends on it. Vendors and the open source community are responding, but a primordial soup of new projects has yet to coalesce into a stable standard.\n\nDiscussions at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America this week centered on adjustments that platform engineers and internal developer platform products have made as cost and data privacy concerns drive generative AI workloads out of public clouds. The absorption of generative AI services into existing platforms will be critical to support what is widely considered the next big trend in tech: agentic AI, where sets of AI microservices operate autonomously.\n\nMeanwhile, for IT pros in the trenches, this rapid adaptation has proven challenging, said Kasper Borg Nissen, a staff platform engineer at digital bank Lunar in Denmark, during a keynote presentation this week.\n\n\"According to recent surveys done by Gartner, McKinsey and more, 65% of organizations are now regularly using generative AI across multiple functions, and furthermore, 96% of companies expect AI to become a key enabler of business growth and operational improvements,\" Nissen said. \"However, significant challenges remain -- 49% of companies struggle to estimate and demonstrate AI's business value, and only 9% of organizations were considered AI mature.\"\n\nTo fill this gap, vendors across the IT infrastructure landscape are polishing their wares to support large language model operations, or LLMOps. In the GPU space, two nemesis chipmakers opened a new frontier of competition this year in the form of AI microservices orchestration projects: Intel's Open Platform for Enterprise AI and Nvidia Blueprints. Both offer a catalog of components platform engineers can assemble to quickly spin up services that support common AI agent workloads, including conversions between text, images, audio and video.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The reason why Nvidia has become so popular in GPUs is because of their software stack and because of their firmware. Andy ThuraiAnalyst, Constellation Research\n\nIt's still very early for both projects, but their success will likely be influenced by broader market battles, according to Andy Thurai, an analyst at Constellation Research. Nvidia has already replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and sales of Intel's Gaudi 3 AI chip have not met expectations. Part of that is due to Nvidia's strength in software-based automation, he said.\n\n\"Here's the bottom line: The reason why Nvidia has become so popular in GPUs is because of their software stack and because of their firmware,\" Thurai said in an interview this week. \"They made it so easy for people to use any of the AI/ML models, whereas Intel let them adopt them any way [users] wanted. I think Nvidia will nail them.\"",

Despite the widespread use of generative AI, many organizations face challenges in demonstrating its business value and achieving AI maturity. Vendors are enhancing their offerings to support LLMOps, with Intel and Nvidia launching AI microservices orchestration projects to facilitate AI agent workloads.

        "content": "Intel created the OpenVINO toolkit (open source) to more efficiently integrate AI into a typical workflow (no internet connection required).\n\nOpenVINO aims to deliver accurate results while optimizing hardware use by running AI models on supported accelerators, like CPU, GPU, and NPU.\n\nIntel’s Audacity plugin suite includes AI-powered effects, generators, and analyzers.\n\nThese AI tools run 100% locally without an internet connection, and I’m sure this news will convince more potential users to try them.\n\nThe featured plugins are Music Separation, Noise Suppression, Music Generation & Continuation, and Whisper Transcription.\n\nIt’s fitting that the first plugin deals with track separation since that brought many of us to Audacity years ago.\n\nMy first interaction with Audacity came through looking for instrumentals and acapella versions for beat-making and remixes.\n\nNow, we have AI giving us the choice of two stems (Vocals/Instruments) or four stems (Vocals/Drums/Bass/Other Instruments).\n\nAI stem separation has been around for a few years; we’ve seen services like LALAL.AI improve over time, and although not perfect, it’s come a long way.\n\nThe Noise Suppression plugin removes background noise from any sample containing spoken audio.\n\nAgain, many existing tools tackle the problem of unwanted background noise, but anything that makes it faster and easier is welcome.\n\nThe next plugin is where I have reservations about the advent of AI in music: Music Generation & Continuation.\n\nThis plugin allows users to generate snippets of music from a text prompt or a continuation from an existing snippet. For me, it’s a fine line between helping and replacing the musician.\n\nWe aren’t there yet, so I try to see the positives in what we can learn through AI, but if we ever reach a point when someone has a hit record with no personal input other than typing, make me a dance track that sounds like Tom Jones singing Gangnam Style, I’ll be pretty sad.\n\nThe last plugin is Whisper Transcription, which should be very handy for podcasters. One of the cool things here is that it can translate as well as transcribe. You can specify the source language or use the plugin’s auto-detection process.\n\nThere’s just one day left to enter our Mode Audio Airspace giveaway (the promo ends on November 15, 2024), so if you haven’t entered, do it now, and good luck!\n\nDownload: OpenVINO AI Plugins (FREE)\n\nMore:",

        "content": "Intel is coming around to the idea of large last-level caches on its processors. Florian Maislinger, a tech communications manager for Intel, in an interview with Der8auer and Bens Hardware, revealed that the company is working on augmenting its processors with large shared L3 caches, however, it will begin doing so only with its server processors. The company is working on a new server/workstation processor for 2025 that comes with cache tiles that augment the shared L3 cache on its server processor, so it excels in the kind of workloads AMD's EPYC \"Genoa-X\" processors and upcoming \"Turin-X\" processors excel at—technical computing. On \"Genoa-X\" processors, each of the up to 12 \"Zen 4\" CCDs comes with stacked 3D V-Cache, which is found to have a profound impact on performance in applications that are cache-sensitive, such as the Ansys suite, OpenFOAM, etc.The interview reveals that the server processor with large last-level cache should come out in 2025, however there is no such effort on the horizon for the company's client processors, such as the Core Ultra \"Arrow Lake-S,\" at least not in the year 2025. The company's recently launched \"Arrow Lake-S\" desktop processors do not provide a generational gaming performance uplift over the 14th Gen Core \"Raptor Lake Refresh,\" however, Intel claims to have identified certain correctable reasons for the gaming performance falling below expectations, and is hoping to release updates to the processor (possibly in the form of a new microcode, or something at the OS-vendor level). This, the company claims, should improve the gaming performance of \"Arrow Lake-S.\"",

This move aims to improve performance in cache-sensitive workloads, similar to AMD's EPYC \"Genoa-X\" and upcoming \"Turin-X\" processors. However, there are no current plans to implement large last-level caches in Intel's client processors, such as the Core Ultra \"Arrow Lake-S,\" by 2025. The recently launched \"Arrow Lake-S\" desktop processors have not shown significant gaming performance improvements over the previous generation, but Intel has identified issues and plans to release updates to address them.

        "content": "M4 MacBook Pro reviews mostly endorsed my own view that, while the machine would make a great purchase for Intel MBP owners, there isn’t a compelling reason for any M-series user to upgrade.\n\nHowever, it turns out that Apple quietly gave the latest MacBook Pro a new display tech, offering two benefits …\n\nMacBook display tech\n\nMacBook displays still use IPS LCD screens, though of a far higher quality than offered in most laptops.\n\nApple describes them by the term miniLED – a reference to the much-improved backlighting in which many more, smaller LEDs allow far greater local brightening and dimming of the display.\n\nIn this way, while the underlying tech is unchanged from earlier models, there’s a notable improvement in brightness and contrast.\n\nM4 MacBook Pro got a display upgrade\n\nPrevious M-series MacBook Pro models used a red KSF phosphor film to enable the miniLED backlighting to produce a wider color gamut than would normally be possible.\n\nThis film is also very efficient, but there’s an even better film available, known as quantum dot. Display analyst Ross Young reports that Apple quietly introduced this to the M4 MacBook Pro.\n\nBig Apple display news, they have adopted quantum dots for the first time. The latest MacBook Pro’s (M4) use a quantum dot (QD) film rather than a red KSF phosphor film.\n\nYoung says this provides the latest models with two advantages over earlier models.\n\nBetter color gamut and better motion performance.\n\nOne commenter said that tests verified the faster response rate.\n\nPixel response is pretty clearly significantly faster when TestUFO motion tests seen side by side, you can go to Apple Store & run testufo.com versus M1. The M4 LCD is noticeably faster.\n\nApple had good reason to wait\n\nThe reason the company hadn’t done this before, says Young, is due to a mix of relatively poor efficiency and the fact that earlier generations of QD contained cadmium.\n\nIn the past, Apple went with the KSF solution due to better efficiency and lack of cadmium (Cd)\n\nApple commented on not wanting to use cadmium as long ago as 2015.\n\nThe World Health Organization classifies the element as a human carcinogen, and one particular danger is the recycling or disposal of electronics containing the metal.\n\nCadmium exerts toxic effects on the kidneys as well as the skeletal and respiratory systems. It is classified as a human carcinogen. It is generally present in the environment at low levels; however, human activity has greatly increased levels in environmental media relevant to population exposure. Exposures potentially of particular concern for children include disposal and recycling of electronic and electrical waste.\n\nPhoto: Apple",
        "summary": "The M4 MacBook Pro reviews suggest that while it is a great upgrade for Intel MacBook Pro users, it may not be necessary for current M-series users. Apple has quietly introduced a new display technology in the M4 MacBook Pro, using quantum dot film instead of the previous red KSF phosphor film, which enhances color gamut and motion performance. This change results in a notable improvement in brightness, contrast, and faster pixel response rates, as verified by tests. Apple had previously avoided using quantum dots due to efficiency concerns and the presence of cadmium, a toxic element, in earlier generations. The decision to switch to quantum dots now reflects advancements in the technology that align with Apple's environmental and health standards.",

        "content": "Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .\n\nThe HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is our first look at how Intel’s Lunar Lake platform performs in HP’s recently formed Omni realm (after it shook off most of its existing PC brands earlier this year ). In recent months, we’ve tested the Arm-powered OmniBook X and AMD-equipped OmniBook Ultra from the company’s revamped lineup, both of which were slim and solid laptops.\n\n\n\nThis time around, we’re looking at a convertible that, while pleasing, doesn’t look or feel all that new. That, plus the ample amount of pre-installed software (most of which wants to track and / or push ads at you), the removal of the still-useful USB-A port, and Microsoft’s continuing delay of Recall (the promised flagship feature of Copilot+) makes the OmniBook Ultra Flip less appealing than its Spectre predecessor.\n\nDesign of the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nAs its name implies, the OmniBook Ultra Flip is a convertible, with a fold-over hinge. Its solid-feeling metal shell and pleasing keyboard (complete with a retooled Function row and light-blue power button) give it design cohesion with its other OmniBook counterparts. But its angled rear edges, complete with USB-C ports, echo previous designs.\n\n\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is clearly a somewhat revamped and rebranded HP Spectre x360 14 with a different exterior finish. And that’s not a bad thing given we mostly liked the Spectre design. But the Flip’s 12.35 x 8.51 x 0.59-inch dimensions and 2.97-pound weight are strikingly similar to the 2024 Spectre x360 (12.35 x 8.68 x 0.67 inches and 3.19 pounds). The Ultra Flip is a little thinner and a little lighter, but to get there, HP has thrown out the handy USB-A port as part of the move to the Omni brand.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nYou do still get a decent number of ports by 2024 standards, though. On the left edge lives a 10Gbps USB-C port (on the rear corner), alongside an audio jack.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe right side houses two Thunderbolt 4 ports, again with one on the rear corner and one nearby on the side of the laptop. I do like that HP has included USB Type-C on both sides of the laptop, but only the Thunderbolt ports can be used for charging, so you’ll have to plug your charger in on the right side.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe angled nature of the rear ports on either side means, unfortunately, you can’t plug anything bulky into them, like one of the best flash drives , at least when using the device as a laptop, because the lid gets in the way.\n\n\n\nLenovo’s Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition laptop manages to be slightly slimmer (0.55 inches) while adding both a USB-A and HDMI port. It’s also heavier than the OmniBook Ultra Flip, at 3.37 pounds, but packs in a larger 15.3-inch screen.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 Specifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally CPU Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Row 0 - Cell 2 Graphics Intel Arc 140V Row 1 - Cell 2 Memory 32 GB LPDDR5x-8533 MT/s Row 2 - Cell 2 Storage 2TB PCIe Gen4 Row 3 - Cell 2 Display 2800x1600 OLED Row 4 - Cell 2 Networking Intel Wi-Fi 7 BE201 (2x2), Bluetooth 5.4 wireless card Row 5 - Cell 2 Ports Camera 9MP IR camera Row 6 - Cell 2 Battery 64 WHr Row 7 - Cell 2 Power Adapter 65 W USB-C power adapter Row 8 - Cell 2 Operating System Windows 11 Home Row 9 - Cell 2 Dimensions (WxDxH) 12.35 x 8.51 x 0.59 inches Row 10 - Cell 2 Weight 2.97 pounds Row 11 - Cell 2 Price (as configured) $1,899.99 ($1,499 sale price) Row 12 - Cell 2\n\nProductivity Performance of the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nWe tested the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip against several recent systems, including recent Dell XPS 13 models with both Intel Core Ultra 7 258V and Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite CPUs, the 15-inch M3 Macbook Air , and Lenovo’s Yoga Slim 7i, a more affordable ($1,299 as tested) non-convertible laptop with a Core Ultra 7 256V CPU – effectively the same CPU as the 258V in the Ultra Flip, but with 16GB of integrated RAM rather than the 32GB of the 258V. We also included our results from the previous-generation HP Spectre x360 14 , which is where the Ultra Flip gets most of its design DNA.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nIn Geekbench 6, the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 beat the last-gen Spectre x360 and Lenovo’s Yoga in the single-core test and the Yoga in multi-core. But both the Qualcomm-powered XPS 13 and the M3-powered Macbook Air did better in both single- and multi-core results here.\n\n\n\nThings looked better for the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 on our file copy test, where it transferred our 25GB of test files at just over 1,700 MBps. That was faster than every other competing machine – save for the previous-gen HP, which was about 100 MBps faster.\n\n\n\nWith Handbrake, we have computers transcode a 4K video to 1080p. And we use the Arm-specific versions of Handbrake for the Arm-based laptops and the traditional x86 version of the program for Intel and AMD laptops. Here the OmniBook Ultra Flip’s showing of 6:37 outpaced the Intel-powered XPS 13 (8:35) and the Spectre x360 (7:09). But the other competitors were faster, with the Snapdragon-based XPS 13 easily outpacing everything else, finishing in just 4 minutes and 47 seconds.\n\nTo measure long-term performance, we run 10 loops of the Cinebench 2024 CPU test and observe how the scores change, with less change suggesting more stable thermal performance.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe Ultra Flip started at a high of 528.2 before dipping about 100 points for one run, then recovering and hovering between 460 and 470 for the rest of the test. The Intel Core Ultra 7 258V's performance cores ran at an average of 3.1 GHz, while the efficiency cores ran slightly higher at 3.3 GHz. During the stress test, the CPU averaged 76.3 degrees C.\n\nDisplay on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nAs a premium convertible, the 2800 x 1600 OLED screen is clearly a focus for the OmniBook Ultra Flip, and anecdotally it doesn’t disappoint. I watched the trailer for the second season of “Silo,” and the blue of Rebecca Ferguson’s eyes was striking against the deep OLED black of the background near the beginning, and the flame-like orange of the title screen at the end really popped. Watching on this screen made me more excited for the show’s return next month.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nIn testing, the Ultra Flip did better than most competitors in terms of color reproduction, delivering 84.3% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and was close enough in all measurements to the Spectre x360 that the two likely share the same panel. That said, the Lenovo’s Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition's bigger screen was brighter and also more vivid in our tests. At 359.6 nits, the Ultra Flip was actually the dimmest of our premium competitors, with the MacBook Air being the second-brightest at 482.4 nits. But all of the displays here put out a good amount of light for most use cases. You might like the Yoga or MacBook a bit more if you frequently use your computer in direct sunlight, but the high contrast of OLED helps on that front as well.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nThe keyboard on the Ultra Flip seems predominantly the same as the 2024 Spectre x360, and largely that’s a good thing. The half-height Function row is now a lighter gray than the rest of the keys, and the buttons get reshuffled a bit. A dedicated calculator button replaces the camera privacy button (which is now a physical switch up above the camera), and the power button in the upper right now sets itself apart in a pleasing light blue hue.The large, clean key labels remain, as does the pleasing tactility of the key feedback. The half-size up / down arrow keys also carry over, but they didn’t take much time for me to get used to. I don’t think I’d have major complaints using this keyboard as my daily productivity driver.\n\n\n\nThe large 6.25-inch diagonal touchpad also carries over from the Spectre, and I found it to work well for basic navigation and multi-touch gestures. That said, much like our reviewer for the previous Spectre x360, I found the default haptic intensity a little stronger than necessary, so I turned it down to 25%.\n\nAudio on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nThe speakers on the Ultra Flip sound solid, with a nice amount of volume and more lower-mids than I would expect from a PC this slim. I listened to Urban Heat’s album, “The Tower,” and the laptop’s speakers nicely showcased Jonathan Horstmann’s baritone crooning. As is usually the case with slim PCs, there isn’t a massive amount of true low-end here, but the speakers deliver a warm sound with quite a bit of volume and no audible distortion.\n\nThe MyHP app does have presets for movies, music, and voice, as well as an equalizer, but I was pretty happy with the sound profile of the speakers at their default setting.\n\nUpgradeability of the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nGetting inside the Ultra Flip is fairly easy, so long as you have a screwdriver with a tiny Torx or star bit. The bottom is held on by just four screws, two short ones up front and a pair of longer ones in the back. With those out, you’ll need some kind of prying device to begin loosening the clips. After I worked my way around a few sides, the bottom popped off easily.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nInside though, the only major component you’ll be able to upgrade is the SSD, which is housed under a metal cover that’s screwed down on both sides and doubles as a heat dissipator. The battery looks like it would be fairly easy to replace if you need to do that. But the wireless card is soldered down and the RAM is, of course, now integrated into the Intel CPU.\n\nBattery Life on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nAt 12 hours and 2 minutes, the OmniBook Ultra Flip lasted an hour and change longer than the previous-gen Spectre x360 on our battery test, which consists of web browsing, video streaming, and OpenGL graphics tests at 150 nits of screen brightness.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe UItra Flip outlasted the Spectre x360 from earlier this year, but everything else here lasted longer. The MacBook Air (15:05) was helped by its larger chassis and Arm CPU, while the two XPS 13s (17:29 Intel and 19:31 Qualcomm) were both aided by smaller displays and lower resolutions. The high pixel count and OLED tech of the Ultra Flip don’t do its longevity any favors, but 12 hours and 2 minutes of run time is still a decent showing.\n\nHeat on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nWe measure a laptop’s surface temperature while running 20 loops of Cinebench 2024, which stresses the system for a couple of hours. During our testing, the Ultra Flip’s keyboard topped out at 100 degrees Fahrenheit, although that was between the 7 and 8 keys, while the letter keys where your fingers are going to be spending most of their time remained a cooler 93 degrees F or below. This is lower than plenty of other slip portables.\n\n\n\nThe touchpad topped out at 78.5 F in the upper-right corner. And the underside of the laptop didn’t get that much warmer than the top, peaking at 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the middle rear, near the hottest spot on the keyboard. I wouldn’t exactly say Flip Ultra runs cool, but it doesn’t get particularly hot. And while the fans were audible in my quiet home office while running Cinebench, they were more like a persistent whisper than anything approaching noisy or whiny.\n\nWebcam on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe 9MP webcam and IR camera are also likely carryovers from the Spectre x360, and are quite good – especially if you’re coming from the 1080p or even 720p webcams that have been typical on most laptops for years. Colors were accurate and there was a fair amount of detail visible in my sun-lit home office. And perhaps most impressively, the webcam dealt with the light from my two windows about as well as my dedicated Anker webcam. You can still get better detail and contrast from one of the best webcams, but the camera here is more than good enough for meetings, family chats, and the occasional photo.\n\nSoftware and Warranty on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\nHP includes a fair amount of its own software as well as some third-party programs on the Ultra Flip. There’s Poly Camera Pro, which lets you adjust things like brightness and saturation on the webcam, as well as adding various filters and watermarks, as well as adjusting framing.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nHP Smart is an app that oddly focuses heavily on printing from its front page – which isn’t so odd once you remember that printers are still a big part of HP Inc.’s business.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe HP Omen gaming app is also here, which feels strange for a decidedly non-gaming PC, though Intel’s integrated graphics have decidedly improved, and as the app handily suggests, you can always use Nvidia’s GeForce Now to offload your game rendering to the cloud. In case this didn’t already feel enough like an ad, when you launch the app for the first time, it asks permission to push ads to you.\n\n\n\nMcAfee LiveSafe security and VPN software is also installed. And I thought perhaps HP had at least included a very generous trial. Because when I launched the program it said \"Trial ends in 1,342 days -- Buy now.\" But, looking at HP’s product page, this is supposed to be just a 30-day trial. So there seems to be some kind of error with the installation on our review unit.\n\n\n\nThen of course there’s Copilot +, a feature package that’s supposed to lean on the Intel NPU for locally computed AI tasks. The feature was first supposed to roll out with laptops based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors earlier this year. But the flagship Recall feature, which takes and serves up screenshots of nearly everything you do on your PC, was first… recalled in June over security and privacy issues. Then Microsoft said the feature wasn’t going to be optional when it eventually did roll out, but soon backpedaled . Then, amazingly as I was wrapping up this review, the company delayed the feature yet again – with a new promise that it will be available for preview in December to those running Windows Insider builds.\n\n\n\nIn all, HP includes a plethora of extra software here for a premium PC. And one of its key promised features – whether you want it or not – keeps getting pushed back. I generally wouldn’t buy any laptop for its included software, but Microsoft (and by extension HP and other Copilot+ PC makers) keeps trying to convince consumers (and the tech press) that localized AI software is the next big thing – while failing again and again to deliver its flagship feature in Windows 11 nearly six months after it was first announced.\n\n\n\nI’m still fairly convinced that the best premium software feature for a PC is no extra software at all, save for your OS of choice. For better or worse, what HP delivers with the OmniBook Ultra Flip feels like the opposite of that, with the added bonus of some software features I probably don’t want coming at some point in the near future.\n\n\n\nHP sells the Ultra Flip with a one-year warranty.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 Configurations\n\nOur review configuration of the Ultra Flip, with an Intel Core Ultra 258V (which includes 32GB of RAM), a 2TB SSD, and a 2880 x 1800 OLED touchscreen has an MSRP of $1,899. But when we wrote this it was currently on sale for a more reasonable $1,499 . HP also says this configuration will be available in mid-January at Best Buy for $1,899, though I’d hope the fact that HP is already selling it at a steep discount indicates the Best Buy price will be significantly lower as well.\n\n\n\nAll configurations of the Ultra Flip sport the same OLED display. But if you can live with two fewer CPU cores, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the Ultra Flip starts as low as $1,049 .\n\nBottom Line\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nIn terms of hardware, the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is mostly very good, with a great screen and keyboard for a light convertible, and more ports than most (even if there’s no USB-A and the angled ports on the corners aren’t always convenient). The upgrade to Arrow Lake is also mostly a positive one, delivering an hour extra of battery life in our testing and better single-core (though generally worse multi-core) performance. The high-resolution webcam is also arguably better than almost anyone needs for keeping up with colleagues and family while at home or on the go.\n\n\n\nThe primary letdown comes from the device’s software – both preinstalled and promised but delayed. HP includes several of its own apps, some of which are pleasingly functional (the Poly camera app in particular is nice), but many of which ask you for permission to track your use, push ads, or both. Then there’s McAfee and Adobe trials, Google Play Games Beta, and Dropbox. It all just feels like a lot for a device with a $1,899 MSRP as configured (though it was $400 off when I wrote this at HP).\n\n\n\nThere’s also the whole Copilot+ aspect, which Microsoft and its partners keep pushing with new premium devices, despite a repeated inability to actually ship the primary feature: Recall. As of this writing, Microsoft says Recall will be available in December – but only to those running its Insider Windows build. That’s not HP’s fault, though, and I don’t want to single one company out for the failings of its software partner, which of course affects every other Copilot+ PC, at least for now.\n\nBut without Recall or some other game-changing feature, the Ultra Flip feels like a slightly retooled Spectre x360 with a lot of unneeded and nagging software, somewhat better battery life, and performance that’s better in some ways but worse in others.\n\n\n\nIf you can find a last-gen Spectre x360 at a reduced price, you might want to consider that. If you like the idea of Copilot+, current-gen CPUs, and you want a convertible, the Ultra Flip seems to be the only option right now.\n\nMORE: How to Buy a Gaming Laptop\n\nMORE: Best Gaming PCs\n\nMORE: Best Ultrabooks and Premium Laptops",

        "content": "The venerable NUC brand, now presided over by Asus rather than Intel (and open to several other PC OEMs, like MSI), is home to a host of appealing mini desktops for different use cases. Most are general-purpose or lower-power kiosk systems, but Asus is trying its hand at a gaming-centric take with the Republic of Gamers NUC 970 (starts at $1,399; $1,799 as tested). The ROG 970 is a very compact box—smaller than a laptop—that uses mobile CPU and GPU chips to jam in the power. Our test model touts an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and a GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU, which posted similar performance to full-size entry-level gaming desktops in our testing. That's an appealing offer if you're seeking a space-saving solution that, if not fully upgradable, at least allows memory and storage swaps. You can get more gaming bang for the buck with a traditional tower, but for small-form-factor shoppers, this is a highly capable package.\n\nDesign: Compact Versatility\n\nWhile the NUC 970 isn't as configurable as a larger gaming desktop, it isn't a one-model solution, either. Asus' base version costs $1,399 and combines an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU, 16GB of DDR5-5600 memory, a 512GB M.2 solid-state drive, and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 laptop GPU.\n\nOur review unit raises the ante: For $1,799, it packs a Core Ultra 9 185H processor (configured to 65 watts), doubles the RAM and storage to 32GB and 1TB respectively, and steps up to a GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU (115 watts, plus 25 watts dynamic boost). In other words, it delivers a component set roughly equal to a high-end gaming laptop at about the same price.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nOf the many small-form-factor PCs we’ve seen over the years, this is one of the smallest—a 2.5-liter chassis measuring 1.96 by 10.6 by 7.1 inches (HWD), with a vertical stand provided if you'd rather put the system upright. To repeat the obvious, this is possible only by using a mobile GPU rather than a full-size desktop graphics card; if that's a non-starter for you, check out one of the many conventional gaming desktops we've reviewed.\n\nThe case is all black, but the top features a semi-obscured RGB logo, which we've seen on past NUC models when the brand was still under Intel's care. There's more connectivity than you might expect: The front edge is home to two USB Type-A ports, an audio jack, and an SD card slot. Around back are four more USB-A ports, a USB-C Thunderbolt 4 connector, HDMI and two DisplayPort video outputs, and an Ethernet jack. This is an impressive array, though I was surprised to find only one USB-C port.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nAs far as maintenance and internal access, the ROG NUC sports a pretty simple solution. A rear latch lets you slide the case cover open, exposing one captive screw, which you can then loosen. This next part was unclear and required more force than I expected, but pulling the whole upper portion of the casing toward me (arrows on the side with a \"pull\" label indicate the direction) freed it from the base, letting me lift it away from the chassis. Note that a small cable connects the two pieces, so don't rip the cover free without disconnecting the pins.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nFrom here, the tiny motherboard is exposed, letting you easily access the SO-DIMM memory and M.2 SSD. Given the laptop-class CPU and GPU, only the RAM and storage are intended to be readily user-accessible—the chips are locked down and facing toward the cooling system that occupies the other half of the case.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nIn total, that means the system is more accessible than some mini PCs, but not as flexible or upgradable as a traditional tower. At least with the system opened up, you can easily clean out the case and deploy your compressed air of choice to keep the fans running efficiently—more than you can say for some other small-form-factor PCs.\n\nTesting the Asus ROG NUC 970: A Surprising Match for Mainstream Desktops\n\nTo gauge how this unique box performs, we put it through our comprehensive benchmark suite. Since we recently updated our testing regimen, we don't have as many past systems to compare against as usual, but here are the gaming-ready desktop competitors we'll be using:\n\nYou'd expect these systems' full-size desktop GPUs to outperform the Asus' mobile silicon, but two of them—the Lenovo Legion Tower 5i Gen 8 and MSI Codex R2—tilt toward the entry-level side with Nvidia's more modest RTX 4060 rather than 4070, so it may be a tossup. The Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 8 is a higher-end configuration.\n\nProductivity and Content Creation Tests\n\nWe run the same general productivity benchmarks across both mobile and desktop systems. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall system performance and also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive.\n\nThree more benchmarks stress the CPU, using all available cores and threads to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench 2024 uses the company's Redshift engine to render a complex image, while Geekbench 6.3 Pro from Primate Labs simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. We run the multi-core and single-core CPU tests for both. Our last CPU benchmark is the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.8, which converts a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution; lower times are better.\n\nNext, we run one cross-platform content creation benchmark: Adobe Photoshop 2024, using the 1.2.20 version of PugetBench for Creators by workstation maker Puget Systems. This test rates a PC's performance for multimedia applications. PugetBench is an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.\n\nOn the processing side, the ROG NUC held up pretty well against these systems. Its Core Ultra 9 H-series mobile chip can't quite push the same top-end power as the others, particularly the Core i9, but it sits alongside or ahead of the (admittedly cheaper) Core i5 processors in most of these tests. What this translates to is a fast and efficient desktop that's more than capable of serious office work and gaming alike. (Within reason: It's not close to workstation-class, so users planning on CGI rendering or crunching enormous datasets should look for a larger desktop.)\n\nGraphics and Gaming Tests\n\nWe challenge all desktops' graphics with a quartet of animations or gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite. Wild Life (1440p) and Wild Life Extreme (4K) use the Vulkan graphics API to measure GPU speeds, while Steel Nomad's regular and Light subtests focus on APIs more commonly used for game development, like Metal and DirectX 12, to assess gaming geometry and particle effects.\n\nOur real-world game testing comes from the in-game benchmarks of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Cyberpunk 2077, and F1 2024. These three games—all benchmarked at full HD (1080p), 2K (1440p), and 4K (2160p) resolution—represent competitive shooter, open-world, and simulation games, respectively. We run each at high detail or the highest available settings: Extreme for Call of Duty, Overdrive for Cyberpunk, and Ultra High for F1 24.\n\nAs expected, the ROG NUC's laptop-grade GPU couldn't put up numbers with the best desktop GPU here, but it did outperform the desktop RTX 4060 machines, yielding solid numbers for the NUC 970 as a whole. This box can push 60fps in both F1 and Call of Duty on the highest settings—even at 2K resolution in the case of the latter. Cyberpunk on these settings is a bridge too far (the 4K run wouldn't complete and is thus absent), and F1 at higher resolutions is pushing your luck, but there’s plenty of graphics power for gaming in this system...at least as much as in a higher-end gaming laptop.\n\nVerdict: Asus Rewrites the Book on NUC\n\nThe Asus ROG NUC 970 is an uncommon little rig that can solve the needs of space-strapped users, even if it isn't broadly recommendable for the average gamer. You can get more performance per dollar from entry-level and mid-tier alternatives built with desktop, rather than mobile, components. That said, the NUC form factor is the biggest part of the ROG NUC 970's appeal. If you want solid midrange gaming performance in an extra-small package, the NUC 970 will scratch that itch.",

Its Core Ultra 9 H-series mobile chip can't quite push the same top-end power as the others, particularly the Core i9, but it sits alongside or ahead of the (admittedly cheaper) Core i5 processors in most of these tests. What this translates to is a fast and efficient desktop that's more than capable of serious office work and gaming alike. (Within reason: It's not close to workstation-class, so users planning on CGI rendering or crunching enormous datasets should look for a larger desktop.)\n\nGraphics and Gaming Tests\n\nWe challenge all desktops' graphics with a quartet of animations or gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite. Wild Life (1440p) and Wild Life Extreme (4K) use the Vulkan graphics API to measure GPU speeds, while Steel Nomad's regular and Light subtests focus on APIs more commonly used for game development, like Metal and DirectX 12, to assess gaming geometry and particle effects.\n\nOur real-world game testing comes from the in-game benchmarks of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Cyberpunk 2077, and F1 2024. These three games—all benchmarked at full HD (1080p), 2K (1440p), and 4K (2160p) resolution—represent competitive shooter, open-world, and simulation games, respectively. We run each at high detail or the highest available settings: Extreme for Call of Duty, Overdrive for Cyberpunk, and Ultra High for F1 24.\n\nAs expected, the ROG NUC's laptop-grade GPU couldn't put up numbers with the best desktop GPU here, but it did outperform the desktop RTX 4060 machines, yielding solid numbers for the NUC 970 as a whole. This box can push 60fps in both F1 and Call of Duty on the highest settings—even at 2K resolution in the case of the latter. Cyberpunk on these settings is a bridge too far (the 4K run wouldn't complete and is thus absent), and F1 at higher resolutions is pushing your luck, but there’s plenty of graphics power for gaming in this system...at least as much as in a higher-end gaming laptop.\n\nVerdict: Asus Rewrites the Book on NUC\n\nThe Asus ROG NUC 970 is an uncommon little rig that can solve the needs of space-strapped users, even if it isn't broadly recommendable for the average gamer. You can get more performance per dollar from entry-level and mid-tier alternatives built with desktop, rather than mobile, components. That said, the NUC form factor is the biggest part of the ROG NUC 970's appeal. If you want solid midrange gaming performance in an extra-small package, the NUC 970 will scratch that itch.",

        "content": "In context: AMD's 3D V-Cache technology has significantly enhanced gaming performance in the company's last three generations of processors, with rival Intel yet to respond. In a recent interview, Intel revealed that while it has similar technology in development, gaming performance is not its primary focus.\n\nIntel apparently has no plans to produce consumer desktop CPUs featuring 3D-stacked cache to compete with AMD's technology. Instead, the company is focusing on enhancing the cache configuration for its next-generation server CPUs, which it considers a more critical market segment.\n\nOver the past few years, stacking die configurations to expand L3 cache has become a key advantage for AMD. The addition of 3D V-Cache to the Ryzen 5 5800X3D made it arguably the best-value gaming CPU upon its launch in 2022. Its newly released successor, the 9800X3D, has undisputedly claimed the title of the best overall gaming CPU, as confirmed in our review.\n\nHowever, Intel Tech Communications Manager Florian Mailslinger recently told YouTubers der8auer and Bens Hardware that the company's equivalent to 3D V-cache won't debut in desktops. Around the 1-hour and 19-minute mark in the interview below, he confirmed that Clearwater Forest, a lineup of Xeon server CPUs set to arrive in 2025, will feature a technology called Local Cache, which uses vertically stacked tiles.\n\nEvidence of the technology first surfaced in an ICEP 2024 presentation slide from Intel last June. The slide described how Clearwater Forest will employ 3D stacking to increase overall cache capacity and reduce latency between compute and memory – similar to how AMD's X3D chips boost gaming performance.\n\nMailslinger defended Intel's decision by acknowledging that gaming is not a significant mass-market focus for the company. While AMD's 3D V-Cache gives its processors a clear edge over Intel's in gaming scenarios, Mailslinger pointed out that this advantage does not extend to productivity applications – a sentiment echoed in our review of the 9800X3D.\n\nAdditionally, Mailslinger downplayed the impact of Intel's gaming performance gap. Prior testing by TechSpot showed that enhanced cache would not yield a substantial improvement in gaming performance for Intel's 14th-gen Core CPUs.\n\nThe success of Clearwater Forest may play a pivotal role in Intel's future. Production challenges and recent financial struggles have put CEO Pat Gelsinger's efforts to revitalize the company under intense scrutiny. The new server CPUs will introduce Intel's 18A process node, which will determine whether Intel's foundry business can return to competitiveness with industry leader TSMC.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD continues to promise further performance gains with future X3D processors, potentially including the 9900X3D and 9950X3D. While details remain scarce, possible improvements could involve varying SRAM stack sizes or increasing cache capacity on high-end models.",

Intel's decision to prioritize server CPUs over gaming performance is based on its assessment that gaming is not a significant mass-market focus for the company. Despite AMD's gaming advantage with 3D V-Cache, Intel argues that this does not extend to productivity applications, and prior testing suggests that enhanced cache would not significantly improve gaming performance for Intel's current CPUs.

        "content": "A UAE and Middle East-based online retailer just listed a laptop that sports Intel’s upcoming Arrow Lake-H processor. Although it’s still marked as ‘Out of stock,’ Gear-up.me (h/t @momomo_us) lists an Asus Zenbook Duo laptop with updated specs.\n\nThe Zenbook Duo packs an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H chip, 32GB of RAM, 2TB SSD storage, and Windows 11 Pro. However, this dual-screen device isn’t the first to be spotted with the Arrow Lake-H CPU, as we’ve already seen Geekbench 6 benchmarks for the Dell Pro Max 16 with the same processor.\n\nThe website lists the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H with 24 cores and a max CPU frequency of 5.6 GHz, although Geekbench leaks and the previous generation Intel Core Ultra 9 185H only have 16 cores. The 24-core Intel Core Ultra processor would likely sport the HX moniker and have a 5.5 GHz boost clock, but we will have to wait until January 2025, when the company launches the Arrow Lake-H chips, to confirm that.\n\nIntel says its Arrow Lake desktop CPU launch didn’t go as planned, although the company said it will release a patch within the coming month to fix its new processors’ gaming issues. We hope that Team Blue can avoid these problems with its Arrow Lake-H chips, specially designed for high-performance gaming and computing. Nevertheless, it had a relatively successful launch with its mobile-focused Lunar Lake chips, which could potentially beat Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips in the battery life department while avoiding the compatibility issues that still plague Windows on Arm systems.\n\nAside from the anticipated arrival of more powerful mobile chips from Intel, the company is also expected to launch budget-friendly desktop Arrow Lake-S processors at CES 2025. These 200T and 200 non-K chips will have 65W and 35W TDPs spread across Intel Core Ultra 5, 7, and 9. Alongside them, Team Blue will likely announce its more affordable B860 and H810 motherboards, finally allowing budget-conscious buyers to enjoy Intel’s Arrow Lake chips.\n\nHopefully, these chip launches would give Intel the breathing room it needs, especially as it’s still struggling after announcing a $1.6-billion loss in August. After all, Team Blue still has the edge in laptop and mobile computing (partly because of AMD’s own doing), even though Team Red is rapidly gaining on Intel’s dominance in the desktop space.",

        "content": "Intel is readying budget 65W and 35W versions of its Arrow Lake CPUs under the Core Ultra 200 non-K and T lineups, which are expected to arrive by CES 2025. Early benchmarks show that the Core Ultra 265 family delivers up to 5% better performance than its Raptor Lake counterparts in CrossMark per momomo_us on X, which is relatively lower than expected.\n\nThe Core Ultra 7 265 is the direct successor to the Core i7-14700. It features 20 cores (eight P + twelve E) and 20 threads and should have a 65W TDP, which can reach 182W (performance preset PL2) on some boards. The Core Ultra 7 265T retains all these specifications but lowers the TDP to 35W, making it an excellent choice for mini-PCs and SFF builds.\n\nBAPCo's CrossMark repository shows that both CPUs have been tested multiple times using different builds - so we'll average the results for our comparison. The Core Ultra 7 265 and 265T amassed 2,120 and 1,844 points, respectively - landing both CPUs 1% and 5% faster than their predecessors. Compared to AMD's equivalent, Ryzen 7 7700, the Core i7-14700 was already 12% faster, and Arrow Lake extended this lead to 13%. Still, this delta is likely the cause of architectural differences between Intel and AMD.\n\nWhile these results aren't fascinating, CrossMark is one of many benchmarking utilities, so this test isn't enough to draw any conclusions. For context, the 65W Core Ultra 9 285 was recently able to keep pace with the i9-14900K and Core Ultra 7 265K unlocked CPUs in a leaked Geekbench test.\n\nGiven that Arrow Lake scales particularly well at below 100W, it is bound to give AMD serious competition in the budget segment. However, we should mention that Intel's sub-10W (N-series) CPUs will stick with Alder Lake since Arrow Lake is expensive to manufacture and package.\n\nNonetheless, the Core Ultra 200U/H/HX/T/non-K series will likely be unveiled at CES alongside other exciting products from Team Red and Team Green. LGA 1851 adoption should increase in the first quarter as cheaper H810 and B860 motherboards are also coming.",

The Core Ultra 7 265, with 20 cores and a 65W TDP, and its 35W variant, the 265T, are designed for mini-PCs and small form factor builds. While the performance gains over AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 are notable, the differences are attributed to architectural variations between Intel and AMD.

For those unaware, AMD's Phoenix lineup, which was probably one of the most popular ones, saw a refresh: the Ryzen 8000 series \"Hawk Point\" APUs. The most notable change in this refresh was the upgraded NPU, offering up to 16 TOPS.\n\nNow, as revealed earlier and now according to a leak by Golden Pig Upgrade Pack on Weibo (via Olrak_29), AMD plans to introduce a Hawk Point refresh APU lineup under the Ryzen 200 naming scheme, based on the same Zen 4 architecture, with minimal changes expected.\n\nImage Source: Weibo\n\nThe leak doesn't disclose much about potential features or performance, apart from the fact that one of the variants in the lineup is the \"Ryzen 7 255H\", which is likely a refresh of the existing \"Hawk Point\" Ryzen 7 8745HS APU. It is an SKU that launched a few months ago that came with no NPU onboard, The leak claims that the rumored Ryzen 7 255H is set to compete directly with Intel's Core Ultra 7 255H, hence not might AMD make the overall naming scheme confusing, but identical to Intel at the same time.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 7 255H - (Ryzen 7 8745HS Refresh)\n\n(Ryzen 7 8745HS Refresh) AMD's Ryzen 7 265H - (Ryzen 7 8845HS Refresh)\n\nIn terms of what we can expect with the Hawk Point refresh, there won't be a \"significant\" difference to call it a generational upgrade, but a likely improvement area would be in the AI performance, given that the Hawk Point lineup isn't that well-equipped with \"AI TOPS,\" compared to its superior Ryzen AI 300 series. We expect overall core counts and iGPU configurations to remain consistent, given that AMD sticks to what it has been doing with APU refreshes.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 200 APU lineup will certainly fill a void in devices targeting low-to-medium-end workloads, notably handhelds and mini-PCs.\n\nTeam Red is still unable to replicate the hype it saw with \"Phoenix\" APUs when it comes to the adoption of the handheld segment; hence, the Ryzen 200 APUs might work out here perfectly.

        "content": "Not to discount what Intel has done for the desktop processor market, but AMD has secured a whole new echelon with its Ryzen family of CPUs, and with the introduction of its ‘X3D’ brand of products, gaming enthusiasts will no doubt point their attention and wallets to team red. What is even better is that these chips are routinely discounted on Amazon and have garnered incredible levels of popularity to the point that these components have occupied the online retailer’s top 10 best-selling list of CPUs.\n\nFirst, we have the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which went out of stock recently due to sheer demand. Thankfully, Amazon discounted the best gaming processor on the planet, bringing its price down to $399, but as you would expect, with thousands of customers trying to get their fingers on this chip, the price quickly spiked and is now available for a somewhat steep $649.99, with expected delivery happening at the end of November. If you want to save some money and still get sufficient gaming performance from your new build, we recommend getting the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which is currently listed for $458.98.\n\nBoth of these processors feature the same 8-core and 16-thread configuration, with the underlying technology separating the two product generations. Of course, if you do not mind sacrificing a little bit of performance and a few features, you can grab the Ryzen 7 5700X3D, which is available for $200 after a 20 percent price cut. The major downside is that the older motherboards compatible with this processor only support the slower DDR4 RAM, leaving a ton of bandwidth on the table.\n\nThere are several non-X3D CPUs to choose from because some of you might not just be looking to experience the best gaming performance but also in applications that require a ton of horsepower. If you want a combination of a high core count coupled with tremendous performance on a decent budget, the Ryzen 9 5900X will do your bidding just fine. At the end of the day, AMD has plenty of options, but it is up to you on what workloads you will be throwing at these processors, but act fast because it is the holiday season, and it is likely that these prices will fluctuate for several days.\n\nGet the Ryzen 9 5900X from Amazon - $226.96 (60 percent off)\n\nGet the Ryzen 5 7600X from Amazon - $203.59 (32 percent off)\n\nGet the Ryzen 7 5800X from Amazon - $158 (65 percent off)\n\nGet the Ryzen 7 5700X3D from Amazon - $200 (20 percent off)\n\nGet the Ryzen 5 5600X from Amazon - $124 (Wraith Stealth CPU cooler included)\n\nGet the Ryzen 7 7700X from Amazon - $264.99 (30 percent off)\n\nGet the Ryzen 5 5500 from Amazon - $83.58 (47 percent off, Wraith Stealth CPU cooler included)\n\nGet the Ryzen 7 5700X from Amazon - $152.76 (52 percent off)",

As the first Hindu-American woman to serve in Congress and a former Democratic representative from Hawaii, Gabbard has led a fascinating life—shaped by her diverse family, faith, and political journey. While much is known about her career, her family members, including her siblings, remain lesser-known figures, with one in particular—her sister Vrindavan—coming into the spotlight.Tulsi Gabbard, born in Leloaloa, American Samoa, on April 12, 1982, is the fourth of five children in the Gabbard family. Raised in Hawaii from the age of two, Tulsi’s upbringing was strongly influenced by both her parents and the spiritual values they adopted. Her father, Mike Gabbard, a Samoan-American politician and Catholic-turned-Hindu, has served as a Hawaii State Senator since 2006. Her mother, Carol Porter Gabbard, was born to German-European parents but converted to Hinduism before Tulsi’s birth.The Gabbard family follows the Gaudiya Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism, with Tulsi and her siblings adopting names that reflect their spiritual beliefs. Tulsi's siblings include Bhakti, Jai, Aryan, and Vrindavan, each carrying names inspired by their Hindu faith.Among the Gabbard siblings, Vrindavan has gained attention for her role as a deputy U.S. Marshal. She shares a close bond with her sister Tulsi, often appearing alongside her on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. The two sisters are frequently seen attending social gatherings, hosting parties, and enjoying meals together, underscoring the warmth of their relationship. In fact, Vrindavan’s public presence, which includes moments with Tulsi, has sparked interest in her life.Vrindavan’s name itself is symbolic, as it refers to a sacred area in India revered by followers of the Vaishnavism tradition. As a deputy U.S. Marshal, she works in law enforcement, and her career contrasts with her sister’s more political and public advocacy roles. Despite their different paths, the Gabbard sisters share an unbreakable familial connection, which is often evident in their social media posts.Along with Vrindavan, Tulsi has two other siblings—Bhakti and Jai. Bhakti, like her siblings, has a name rooted in Hindu philosophy, which reflects the family's deep spiritual convictions. Jai, another of her brothers, also follows in the family's footsteps, with a name that symbolizes victory and strength in Hindu traditions.The Gabbard family’s spiritual commitment and unique naming practices have shaped the Gabbard siblings’ identities and careers. Tulsi's upbringing in a multicultural household, along with her deep connection to her faith, has been instrumental in shaping her political journey.While Gabbard’s political career has been marked by her time in Congress and her service in the National Guard, it is clear that her family has played an essential role in her life.",

        "content": "American allies could stop sharing sensitive intelligence with the United States if Donald Trump returns to the White House and his criminal classified documents case is abandoned, according to a former U.S. attorney.\nThe claim was made by Barbara McQuade, whom President Obama appointed as U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Michigan, during an appearance on the #SistersInLaw podcast, which she cohosts.\nIn 2023, Trump pled not guilty to 40 federal charges related to claims he illegally held on to classified documents after leaving the White House in January 2021, then obstructed efforts to return them to the relevant authorities. The case was overseen by Special Counsel Jack Smith, who has the same role in Trump's federal election interference case.\nTrump has strongly denied any wrongdoing in the classified documents case, which he insists is politically motivated. Newsweek contacted his 2024 presidential campaign for comment on Saturday by email outside of regular office hours.\nIn July, Florida District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case claiming Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional, though it was widely expected to get refiled. However, according to The New York Times, Smith, whom Trump vowed during the presidential election campaign to fire immediately, intends to resign before the Republican takes office.\nSpeaking on the podcast, McQuade said that \"much of the information\" in the classified documents Trump held onto had come from foreign governments. She added: \"If they think Trump is just going to take all of the secrets they share with us and store it in some bathroom in Mar-a-Lago [Trump's Florida resort], they are not going to share with us anymore, and that sharing is critically important.\"\nMcQuade continued: \"We're not going to get the benefit from that information shared with us by our allies in the future if they don't think Donald Trump is going to be careful with them.\n\"And if you were Great Britain or Australia or Canada or New Zealand, and you know that Donald Trump is back in office, do you think they're going to share their information with us going forward? I don't think so. I think they will be very reluctant. I think it's important ultimately that Donald Trump be held accountable in some way.\"\nJoyce Vance, the former U.S. attorney for the northern district of Alabama who also cohosts the podcast, said that the case and Trump's second election success could impact cooperation with foreign intelligence services.\nVance said: \"The national intelligence communities in other countries that partner with us, they know precisely what happened, behind the curtain, they know what's going on, they know what they're walking into in a second Trump administration.\"\nKimberly Atkins Stohr, a senior opinion writer for The Boston Globe, noted an ex-National Guard soldier was sentenced this month to 15 years in prison for leaking classified papers online.\nSpeaking on the podcast, she said: \"I'm thinking about the former National Guardsman from Massachusetts, Jack Teixeira, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for mishandling classified documents. We have someone else, different case, different facts, but who also mishandled classified documents, and he's going to be in charge of all of them. I think that's what the biggest impact—that's what the legacy of this.\"\nAbout the writer\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is covering U.S. politics and world ...

        "summary": "Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney, warned that American allies might stop sharing sensitive intelligence with the U.S. if Donald Trump returns to the presidency and his classified documents case is dropped. Trump, who pled not guilty to 40 federal charges related to retaining classified documents, has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the case is politically motivated. McQuade emphasized that much of the information in the documents came from foreign governments, and allies might be reluctant to share intelligence if they believe Trump will mishandle it. Joyce Vance, another former U.S. attorney, noted that Trump's potential return to office could affect cooperation with foreign intelligence services. Kimberly Atkins Stohr highlighted the contrast between Trump's situation and a former National Guardsman sentenced to 15 years for mishandling classified documents, suggesting the implications of Trump's case could be significant.",

        "content": "Most of the president-elect’s cabinet choices are “unqualified” and “dangerous,” Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz has said\n\nTulsi Gabbard, US President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for national intelligence director, is “likely a Russian asset,” according to Democratic Party Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. In an interview with MSNBC on Friday, Schulz accused Trump of making “irresponsible” choices for his new cabinet.\n\nGabbard is a former congresswoman from Hawaii and a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserve. An outspoken critic of Washington’s military interventions, she left the Democratic party shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Last month she announced that she had joined the Republican Party and was backing Trump. The president-elect announced her nomination earlier this week, saying that Gabbard “will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career” to the US intelligence community, which includes the NSA, CIA, and FBI.\n\nSchultz claimed that appointing Gabbard to the post would be “dangerous,” as it would make her “a direct line” from the US intelligence community “to our enemies.”\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz is still calling Tulsi Gabbard a “Russian asset.”Furthermore proof that Trump made a phenomenal pick. pic.twitter.com/n2D7IEzhjk — johnny maga (@_johnnymaga) November 15, 2024\n\n“Tulsi Gabbard is someone who has met with war criminals, violated State Department guidance and secretly, clandestinely, went to Syria and met with [President Bashar] Assad. She’s considered to be, by most assessments, a Russian asset,” the congresswoman claimed, saying that she personally considers Gabbard “someone who is likely a Russian asset.” Schultz did not elaborate on her allegations.\n\nGabbard has not yet commented on Schultz’s accusations. She previously welcomed Trump’s nomination in a post on X, thanking the president-elect for the opportunity to “defend the safety, security and freedom of the American people.”\n\nTwitter users were quick to lambast Schultz’s for her remarks, pointing out that she presented no evidence of Gabbard’s alleged spying on Russia’s behalf and calling her claims “defamatory.” One user noted that “whenever the left doesn’t like somebody – they’re a Russian asset.” Gabbard was not the first of Trump’s picks to be accused of having ties to Russia – earlier on Friday, two top Democratic senators demanded a probe into SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over media claims that he had contacts with senior Russian officials. Trump earlier announced that Musk would head the future Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with reforming the US government.\n\nIn her interview, Schultz called Trump’s entire cabinet reshuffle “the most extreme and dangerous” in history and a “Star Wars bar level craziness.” She noted that while a few of Trump’s picks are passable, most are “individually unqualified.”\n\nApart from Gabbard, the congresswoman was especially unhappy with the nomination of former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz for attorney general. She claimed it was “breathtaking in its extremism” as Gaetz has “no experience whatsoever with the Justice Department other than being a subject of investigation for sex trafficking minors.”",
        "summary": "Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz criticized President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet choices, labeling them as \"unqualified\" and \"dangerous,\" particularly targeting Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for national intelligence director, whom she accused of being a \"Russian asset.\" Schultz expressed concerns over Gabbard's past actions, such as meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, and claimed her appointment would pose a security risk. Despite these allegations, Gabbard has not responded, but she previously expressed gratitude for the nomination. Schultz's remarks were met with criticism on social media, with users accusing her of making baseless claims. Additionally, Schultz disapproved of other cabinet nominations, including Matt Gaetz for attorney general, citing his lack of relevant experience.",

        "content": "Those holding out for a desktop Intel Core Ultra CPU with 3D V-Cache will need to wait a while because it's not on the cards or happening anytime soon.\n\nTL;DR: AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D with 3D V-Cache offers enhanced gaming performance by increasing L3 Cache, benefiting gaming workloads. Intel, while developing similar cache-stacking technology, plans to focus on the server market rather than desktop CPUs, as the gaming CPU market is smaller and AMD's chips lag in non-gaming tasks. AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D with 3D V-Cache offers enhanced gaming performance by increasing L3 Cache, benefiting gaming workloads. Intel, while developing similar cache-stacking technology, plans to focus on the server market rather than desktop CPUs, as the gaming CPU market is smaller and AMD's chips lag in non-gaming tasks.\n\nMany PC gamers buy desktop CPUs precisely to run the latest (or their favorite) games, so gaming performance is an important metric when deciding which make and model to choose. With AMD's latest generation of desktop CPUs with 3D V-Cache, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, it's clear that it has once again delivered a PC gaming powerhouse.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\n3D V-Cache is all about stacking extra cache, increasing the available L3 Cache on a CPU - which boosts game performance. It's not something you'd notice in every game or every possible combination of resolution and in-game settings. However, gaming workloads tend to benefit the most from more cache - which has led to many people wondering if Intel might look to implement its version of AMD's 3D V-Cache for its desktop CPU line-up.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9800X3D is AMD's third-generation X3D CPU, so the timing feels right. However, in a new interview with German creators Der8auer and Ben's Hardware, Intel communication manager Florian Maislinger says its \"cache tile\" technology won't be coming to desktops.\n\nYes, Intel is working on cache-stacking technology for CPUs. However, it's planning to implement it in the server market rather than for desktop Intel Core Ultra CPUs. Naturally, data centers are significant for many businesses now - thanks mainly to the current AI boom and everything becoming cloud-based. Also, an Intel Xeon chip with more cache would make Intel a lot more money than a gaming-focused Intel Core Ultra 200 Series.\n\nIn the interview, Intel's Florian Maislinger notes that the desktop CPU market for gamers isn't that large and that Intel sells more CPUs to people and systems that aren't primarily for gaming. One of the downsides of AMD's 3D V-Cache enabled Ryzen chips is that they tend to fall behind in non-gaming productivity workloads. So, for Intel, it sounds like the company doesn't see a benefit in bringing its \"cache tile\" tech to the desktop CPU market anytime soon.",

        "content": "Editor's take: We are frequently asked some version of the question, \"Will someone acquire Intel?\" At this point, we think it is highly unlikely, but these are unpredictable times. Setting aside all the principal considerations – like money, strategy, and regulatory approval – there are a few other hurdles. Chief among these is Intel's license for x86.\n\nApparently, when Intel and AMD resolved their multi-decade dispute over x86, the cross-license agreement included provisions about transferability. If either company is acquired, the other has the right to cancel the license, effectively blocking the deal. When this was signed, we have to think everyone involved assumed it would be AMD getting acquired, but the provision seems to be mutual, and times change.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nGuest author Jonathan Goldberg is the founder of D2D Advisory, a multi-functional consulting firm. Jonathan has developed growth strategies and alliances for companies in the mobile, networking, gaming, and software industries.\n\nSo just for fun, let's think through how that would play out. Right now, the most likely potential buyer of Intel is Broadcom. What would happen if they approached AMD about this license?\n\nAMD would have a few options. Their default position would likely be to just refuse and block the deal. Broadcom is a fearsome competitor, and even if they do not directly compete in every area, a revitalized Intel under Broadcom would be a serious threat to AMD.\n\nThat said, a failed Intel would also be a major problem for AMD, if for no other reason than the two are now linked at the hip when it comes to x86, which AMD needs to remain healthy. All of which is to say there is room for negotiation.\n\nWhat would AMD ask for to grant that approval? Obviously, they would take some cash. However, there is only so much Broadcom would be willing to pay before the Intel deal becomes unappealing. That probably amounts to a few billion dollars. Beyond cash, there are things AMD could ask for that might be worth far more strategically.\n\nFor starters, they could ask Broadcom for help in their fight against Nvidia. This is an area of shared interest between the two companies, and there are likely multiple ways both could benefit from a deeper partnership. For example, Broadcom could invest more heavily in AMD's Ultra Ethernet and other networking initiatives. Alternatively, Broadcom could design an entire networking stack optimized for AMD's Mi300 series of AI accelerators. Going further, AMD could request that Broadcom encourage its AI ASIC customers to adopt AMD-friendly networking interfaces. We imagine there are plenty of novel ways that Broadcom could promote AMD's interests in their combined fight against Nvidia.\n\nAlternatively, AMD could ask Broadcom to steer business toward ZT Systems. After AMD acquires ZT, they plan to sell off ZT's manufacturing side. Securing a healthy backlog of Broadcom orders would certainly make that business more attractive.\n\nAMD would also want to ensure Broadcom continues spinning off Altera, which competes with AMD's Xilinx division. They could even push Broadcom to commit to incorporating more Xilinx products into future designs and reference platforms.\n\nThe point of these demands is that they would cost Broadcom relatively little while potentially offering AMD significant strategic value.\n\nWhile this thought experiment is just for kicks, it highlights one more hurdle for anyone interested in buying Intel. Few potential buyers could offer AMD comparable strategic benefits. For instance, a private equity buyer for Intel would likely have only cash to offer, which might not be enough to get AMD on board. The deal is unlikely, but if it happened, it would shake up many corners of the industry.",
        "summary": "The article discusses the unlikely scenario of Intel being acquired, primarily due to the x86 cross-license agreement between Intel and AMD, which allows either company to cancel the license if the other is acquired. Broadcom is considered the most likely potential buyer, but AMD could block the deal due to competitive concerns. However, AMD might negotiate for strategic benefits, such as assistance in competing against Nvidia or securing business for ZT Systems, rather than just cash. These strategic demands could offer AMD significant value while costing Broadcom relatively little. The article concludes that few potential buyers could provide AMD with such benefits, making an acquisition of Intel improbable but potentially industry-shaking if it occurred.",

        "content": "Another leak has surfaced, reinforcing rumors that Intel is planning to reveal Battlemage next month. Hardware data miner and leaker Tomasz Gawroński has shared a Battlemage SoC teaser which is sourced from Gazlog - a Japanese blog. The authenticity of this image is something we cannot be certain about. However, in tandem with previous leaks, there is a distinct possibility we will see Battlemage arrive before RDNA 4 and Blackwell.\n\nA few days prior, we covered a similar leak from Golden Pig Upgrade Pack who very subtly suggested a December showcase for Battlemage on desktop. It is pertinent to mention that Battlemage or Xe2 first launched with Intel's Lunar Lake (Core Ultra 200V) chips this year. Since Arc Alchemist dGPUs (Discrete GPUs) hit shelves, Intel has been very secretive about the future of Arc - with some taking this as indicative of the division's potential closure. Strangely enough, you'd expect Intel to be pretty vocal if it is indeed launching Battlemage next month - so it is best to take this claim with a pinch of salt. Nonetheless, both leaks only point towards an announcement so it may take a few days or even weeks before these GPUs hit retail.\n\nThese reports show Intel's great ambitions and hopes for its GPU division and recent benchmarks indicate that Team Blue has caught up to AMD. This is a rather positive outlook for Battlemage if it can keep pace with RDNA 3.5 - although RDNA 4 could be a different story since it pins a strong emphasis on better RT and maybe even hardware-based upscaling capabilities. Per previous leaks, Intel has three GPUs planned for Battlemage: Arc BMG-31, Arc BMG-20, and Arc BMG-G10 with BMG-31 rumored to feature (possibly up to) 32 Xe-cores.\n\nAgain, will the average consumer go out of their way and pick Intel over Nvidia and AMD who've already established their foothold in the market? Case in point; despite AMD's competitive offerings, it is still struggling to penetrate the gaming market against Nvidia - as no Radeon card ranks within the top 30 GPUs on Steam's hardware survey. Moreover, are Intel's drivers up to the mark? With these concerns in mind, Intel will have to offer some strong incentives such as greater value and higher VRAM capacities as the market desperately needs affordable yet capable GPUs. It'll be great to see if Team Blue can launch a few 12GB or even 16GB variants for the budget segment - setting a new standard and pushing Nvidia and AMD to follow suit.\n\nIf this leak proves accurate, and if Intel can dish out ample volume before the holiday season, that could give it a serious headstart advantage. Remember, RDNA 4 and Blackwell (RTX 50) GPUs are still slated for CES 2025 in January.",
        "summary": "Recent leaks suggest that Intel may reveal its Battlemage GPUs next month, although the authenticity of these leaks is uncertain. The leaks, including one from a Japanese blog and another from Golden Pig Upgrade Pack, hint at a potential December showcase for Battlemage on desktop. Intel has been secretive about its Arc GPU division, leading to speculation about its future, but recent benchmarks show Intel catching up to AMD, which is promising for Battlemage. Intel plans to release three Battlemage GPUs, with the BMG-31 rumored to have up to 32 Xe-cores, but it remains to be seen if consumers will choose Intel over established competitors like Nvidia and AMD. If Intel can release these GPUs in significant volume before the holiday season, it could gain a competitive advantage, especially as RDNA 4 and Blackwell GPUs are expected in early 2025.",

        "content": "AMD has recently been on a roll with its desktop chips, growing its desktop processor market share to 28.7% in 3Q24 versus 15.8% just five years prior. This is a stunning 81% jump for AMD, and all at the expense of Intel. You can see evidence of this for yourself when you look at the best-selling CPUs on Amazon, with the top 10 spots held by AMD processors from the Ryzen 5000, 7000, and 9000 processor series. Intel sits awkwardly at 11th place, with its Intel Core i7-13700K, a processor two generations behind its latest parts.\n\nSome might argue that the Intel Core Ultra 200 chips are too new to penetrate Amazon’s bestseller list, but AMD’s premier gaming chip, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, has launched just this month and it’s already at pole position. This is despite the massive demand that drove prices up to more than $600 (from the original launch price of $479). If that is out of your range, you could go for the previous generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which sits at the number two spot and has a far more accessible asking price of $349.\n\nAt number three, we have the four-year-old Ryzen 9 5900X, costing $226 — this is 60% off its launch price, making it a tempting deal for budget-conscious buyers who still want 24-threads of performance. It even outsells the Ryzen 9 5900XT, which launched this year but is more expensive at $308. The AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, priced at $194, sits in fourth place, while the older 12-thread (and cheaper, at $105) Ryzen 5 5600X is one place behind at fifth place.\n\nSpots six through ten in the Amazon CPU bestseller list are rounded out by the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D, Ryzen 7 5700X, Ryzen 7 7700X, Ryzen 7 5800X, and Ryzen 5 5500. These processors give buyers a wide range of options — the cheapest processor starts at less than $100 and those who have the money could splurge more than $500, allowing you to get the best CPU for gaming in your budget.\n\nWhat’s interesting, though, is that there’s only one Ryzen 9000 series processor here. This is probably because of the disappointing benchmark results returned by the non-X3D variants at launch, with the company soon releasing a patch to fix the issue. Nevertheless, this small hiccup is nothing compared to the major headache that Intel has experienced with its high-end Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh desktop chips.",
        "summary": "AMD has significantly increased its desktop processor market share to 28.7% in the third quarter of 2024, largely at Intel's expense, as evidenced by AMD's dominance in Amazon's best-selling CPU list. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D, despite its recent launch and high demand-driven price increase, has quickly become the top seller. Budget-conscious buyers can opt for older models like the Ryzen 9 5900X, which offers substantial performance at a reduced price. The top ten best-selling CPUs on Amazon are all AMD processors, offering a wide range of options for different budgets. Despite a minor issue with the Ryzen 9000 series, AMD's success contrasts sharply with Intel's struggles with its Raptor Lake series.",

While both lineups will arrive in Q1 2025, we got an early listing of one of these chips on an ASUS laptop.\n\nAs spotted by @momomo_us, the UAE-based retailer Gear-Up has recently listed the \"ASUS UX8406CA\" Zenbook Duo for 1421.93 Bahraini dinars, or around $US3679.\n\nCoincidently, this is the same laptop that was listed on a Russian retailer in September. At this price point, we usually get high-end gaming laptops, featuring RTX 4080 or RTX 4090 GPUs, along with flagship Intel chips. The price may drop with the official release, as the previous leak suggested a US$2890 price tag.\n\nImage Source: Gear-Up\n\nIt's more of a productivity laptop that has no dedicated GPU and works with Integrated Arc Graphics. It's powered by the flagship Core Ultra 9 285H processor from the Core Ultra 200H series, featuring 16 cores. However, the specs sheet shows that the processor brings 24 cores with a clock speed of up to 5.6GHz.\n\nAccording to the previous leak, the Core Ultra 9 285H should feature up to a 5.4 GHz max turbo P-core clock, and therefore a 24-core configuration may be an error. The Core Ultra 9 285H features 8 Xe cores at 2.35 GHz and has a TDP of 45W. The ASUS Zenbook Duo laptop here brings a dual-screen layout, allowing users to use either one or both screens in whatever layout they like.\n\n2 of 9\n\nThe second display can be attached beneath the keyboard as well, letting you use it as a regular laptop, and the keyboard is detachable as well, which lets both displays act as a dual-stack monitor setup. The specs sheet reveals that it comes with 32 GB of RAM, a 2 TB SSD storage, and will weigh 1.65 kg. The specs are almost identical to the Russian listing, but the latter had 2880x1800p resolution and this one has 3072x1920p, which is unusual. Nonetheless, the screen size is the same i.e., 14 inches, and we can expect a 120Hz 400 nits display.\n\nThe laptop is right now out of stock, and you probably won't be able to buy it soon till the sales embargo is lifted. The Arrow Lake H is the only Arrow Lake lineup that also brings two additional low-power Efficient cores (LPE-Cores) apart from Lion Cove P and Skymont E-Cores.\n\nNews Sources: Gear Up, @momomo_us",

        "content": "Meet the Press host Kristen Welker straight-up asked Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) if President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for intel chief — Rep. Tulsi Gabbard — is “a Russian asset.”\n\nTrump made news this week with cabinet picks that are drawing outrage. Congressman Matt Gaetz (R-FL) to be Trump’s attorney general was met with near-universal shock Wednesday. That selection comes as Trump has picked former Fox News host Pete Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense and Gabbard as his nominee for the director of national intelligence.\n\nOn Sunday morning’s edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Welker confronted Jeffries with the criticism — leveled by many opponents — that Gabbard is a foreign asset.\n\nShe had to ask twice, and Leader Jeffries said he’s not there — yet:\n\nKRISTEN WELKER: President-elect Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, of course, your former colleague in the House. Here’s what Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had to say about her just this week. Take a look. [START TAPE] REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Tulsi Gabbard is someone who has met with war criminals, violated the Department of State’s guidance and secretly, clandestinely went to Syria and met with Assad, who gassed and attacked his own people with chemical weapons. She’s considered to be essentially, by most assessments, a Russian asset. [END TAPE] KRISTEN WELKER: Leader Jeffries, do you agree that she’s a Russian asset? REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Here’s what I have to say about several of the nominations that have been made by the incoming president, including the one that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was referring to. The incoming president, throughout the campaign, promised the American people that we would have the best economy, the best border security and the best administration possible.The question that has to be asked: Is this the best that we can do in the context of some of these nominations? Is this the very best that America has to offer for a moment like this, with so many challenges that we confront? Of course not. America deserves better. Hopefully, we’ll see the Senate Republicans do their job, scrutinize these picks, certainly confirm those that meet the basic level of qualifications and reject others. KRISTEN WELKER: Leader Jeffries, you’re not willing to say she’s a Russian asset? REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, that’s not how I would characterize her at that – this particular juncture. But I’m open to scrutinizing whatever information is presented to all of us. But this is going to fall on Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans.\n\nWatch above via NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nHave a tip for us? tips@mediaite.com",

        "description": "Detailed review of the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite low-cost Intel N100 mini PC with 8GB DDR4 and a 256GB SATA SSD running Windows 11 Pro",
        "link": "https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/11/17/geekom-mini-air12-lite-review-low-cost-intel-processor-n100-mini-pc-windows-11-pro/",
        "publish_date": "2024-11-17T09:15:40Z",
        "content": "We’ve already checked the hardware of the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite mini PC with an unboxing and teardown in the first part of the review. It is a low-cost mini PC based on an Intel Processor N100 CPU, coupled with 8GB DDR4-3200 memory, a 256GB M.2 SATA SSD, dual Display output through HDMI and DisplayPort connector, GbE, WiFi 6E, and a 9-pin expansion header port – as found in some NUC model – to access an external power button, reset button, and LEDs when housed in a cabinet or kiosk. You’ll find the full Mini Air 12 Lite specifications in our previous article about it.\n\nWe’ve now had more time to test the mini PC, so we’ll report our experience with the Mini Air12 Lite running Windows 11 Pro operating system in the second part of the review. We’ll go through a software overview, test most of the features, run benchmarks, evaluate Ethernet and WiFi 6 performance, the cooling performance of the mini PC, and measure the fan noise and power consumption under various workloads. We’ll also compare the Mini Air12 Lite to the GEEKOM Mini Air12 with the same Intel N100 CPU that we reviewed at the end of last year.\n\nGEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite can be purchased on Amazon for $179.10 (after ticking the 10% off coupon)\n\nSoftware overview and features testing\n\nGoing to the System->About window in the Settings confirms we have an “Air12_Lite” mini PC with an 800 MHz (base frequency) Intel N100 CPU and 8GB RAM running Windows 11 Pro 23H2 built 22631.4391 after going through all updates available at the time.\n\nHWiNFO64 provides more details about the CPU, motherboard, and Intel UHD graphics. Since we have reviewed so many Alder lake-N platforms there’s nothing really new here, but we can confirm the 8GB DDR4-3200 memory and 256GB Wooposit SATA III (6Gbps) SSD.\n\nThe PL1 and PL2 power limits are set to 15W (PBP) and 25W (MTP) respectively. That’s the same PBP as for the Mini Air12, but the MTP is slightly higher at 25W against 20W for the previous higher-end model, so we can’t expect slightly better default performance when short bursts of processing power are required, provided cooling is adequate. We’ll test that latter.\n\nHWiNFO 64 finds the MediaTek MT7922 Wi-Fi 6E wireless module but does not list any Ethernet controller. That must be because the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite relies on a lesser-known Motorcomm YT6801 Gigabit Ethernet controller as listed in Device Manager.\n\nA few more details about the WiFi 6E module can be found in HWiNFO 64 and we’re connected at 2402 Mbps.\n\nWe can check the Bluetooth version in Device Manager->Bluetooth->MediaTek Bluetooth Adapter, Advanced tab to check the firmware version. “LMP12” looks up to Bluetooth 5.3. We also successfully tested Bluetooth by transferring files to/from an Android smartphone.\n\nWhile both the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite and Mini Air12 are powered by an Intel Processor N100 CPU, there are differences in the RAM and SSD type and capacity. The Lite version comes with 8GB DDR4 and a 256GB SATA SSD, while the Mini Air12 ships with 16GB DDR5 and a faster 512GB NVMe SSD. Both support gigabit Ethernet and WiFi 6, but the implementation is different since the Mini Air12 Lite relies on a Motorcomm YT6801 GbE controller and an MT7922 WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless module while Mini Air12 makes use of a Realtek RTL8168 GbE controller and an RTL8852BE WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 module\n\nThe Mini Air12 Lite mini PC is also equipped with six USB Type-A ports compared to five USB ports, including 2x USB Type-C, in the earlier model. We tested their speed using an ORICO M234C3-U4 M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure for the USB 3.2 ports, and a USB 3.0 hard drive for the USB 2.0 ports, as well as HWiNFO64 program to verify the version and speed and CrystalDiskMark to confirm the transfer speed.\n\nHere are the results for the left USB 3.2 port on the front panel…\n\n… and for the top USB 2.0 port on the rear panel.\n\nHere’s the summary of results for all USB ports (from left to right):\n\nFront panel: USB-A #1 – USB 3.2 Gen2 (SuperSpeed+ 10 Gbps) – Read speed: 1,055 MB/s; write speed: 994 MB/s USB-A #2 – USB 3.2 Gen2 (SuperSpeed+ 10 Gbps) – Read speed: 1,046 MB/s; write speed: 984 MB/s\n\nRear panel: USB-A #1 (top) – USB 2.0 High-Speed (480 Mbps) – Read speed: 43 MB/s; write speed: 43 MB/s USB-A #2 (bottom) – USB 2.0 High-Speed (480 Mbps) – Read speed: 43 MB/s; write speed: 43 MB/s USB-A #3 (top) – USB 3.2 Gen2 (SuperSpeed+ 10 Gbps) – Read speed: 1047 MB/s; write speed: 981 MB/s USB-A #4 (bottom) – USB 3.2 Gen2 (SuperSpeed+ 10 Gbps) – Read speed: 1042 MB/s; write speed: 983 MB/s\n\n\n\nAll six ports work as advertised.\n\nThe Mini Air12 Lite supports up to two independent displays, so we connected a 15.6-inch CrowVi portable display to the DisplayPort 1.4 connector through a DP to HDMI cable and a 21.5-inch GAOMON PD2200 Pen Display to the HDMI port, and it worked without issues.\n\nThat’s another cost-saving compared to the GEEKOM Mini Air12 which can support up to three displays via HDMI 2.0, Mini DP 1.4, and USB Type-C ports.\n\nGEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite Windows 11 benchmarks\n\nWe set the Power mode to “Best performance” before running the benchmarks to evaluate the Mini Air12 Lite’s performance under Windows 11 Pro. Note that the ambient temperature is 26 to 28°C, so we’re doing a “tropical review”, and the results or results from other reviews in cooler climates may differ.\n\nLet’s start with PCMark 10.\n\nThe mini PC achieved 3.176 points in PCMark 10.\n\nIts score in 3DMark Fire Strike was 1,109 points.\n\nThe mini PC got 1346 points in PassMark PerformanceTest 11. The SATA SSD negatively impacts the Disk Mark score and overall results compared to systems with an NVMe drive.\n\nThis is confirmed with CrystalDiskMark reporting 561 MB/s read speed, 503.21 MB/s write speed, and lower random I/O scores. For reference the Mini Air12 achieved 3,400 MB/s reads, 2,900 MB/s writes in the same test, and RND4K Q32T1 results were: 392MB/s and 262MB/s respectively.\n\nThe Cinebench R23 benchmark was used to evaluate the CPU performance and the Mini Air12 Lite achieved 919 points in the single test, and 2862 points in the multi-core test for a respectable 3.11x MP ratio on a quad-core processor.\n\nUnigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 3D graphics benchmarks reported 322 points for the Intel N100 mini PC with the scene rendered at 12.8 FPS on average at the standard 1920×1080 resolution.\n\nLet’s now try to play a few 4K and 8K YouTube videos in Google Chrome.\n\nNo issue at 2160p30 (4Kp30) with just one frame dropped out of 9577 after streaming the video for more than 5 minutes.\n\n4K 60 FPS was fine too with only 10 frames dropped out of 24,307 after playing the video for over 6 minutes.\n\n8K 30 FPS video playback was also smooth with only 5 frames dropped over almost 7 minutes.\n\n8Kp60 (4320p60) was also smooth with no video stuttering. 148 frames were dropped out of 18,071, or a 0.82% drop rate. It’s winter here and the room temperature is closer to 26°C than our usual 28 to 30°C, so it might partially explain it. The results were similar to the GEEKOM Mini Air12 for which our first try at 8Kp60 was not smooth, but a second attempt was just fine. Some more powerful mini PCs have been shown to struggle at 8K 60 FPS, so I’m guessing it’s likely related to cooling and ambient room temperature.\n\nGEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite Windows 11 benchmarks comparison against other N100 mini PCs\n\nLet’s compare Windows 11 benchmark results for the Mini Air 12 Lite against two other Intel Processor N100 mini PCs namely the GEEKOM Mini Air12 and the MINI Z100-0dB with the latter being fanless.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the key specifications between the three systems.\n\nGEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite GEEKOM Mini Air12 MINIX Z100-0dB SoC Intel Alder Lake-N Processor N100 Intel Alder Lake-N Processor N100 Intel Alder Lake-N Processor N100 CPU 4-core/4-thread @ up to\n\n3.4 GHz (Turbo) 4-core/4-thread @ up to\n\n3.4 GHz (Turbo) 4-core/4-thread @ up to\n\n3.4 GHz (Turbo) GPU 24EU Intel HD Graphics 24EU Intel HD Graphics 24EU Intel HD Graphics Memory 8 GB DDR4-3200 16GB DDR5-4800 16 GB DDR4-3200 Storage 256GB SATA SSD 512GB NVMe SSD 512GB NVMe SSD Default OS Windows 11 Pro Windows 11 Pro Windows 11 Pro\n\nAnd now the Windows 11 benchmarks comparison table.\n\nGEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite GEEKOM Mini Air12 MINIX Z100-0dB PCMark 10 3176 3150 3009 - Essentials 7360 7467 7240 - Productivity 4637 4598 4285 - Digital content creation 2549 2471 2386 3DMark (Fire Strike) 1109 1188 1125 PerformanceTest 11.0 1346 1580 1512 - CPU Mark 6123 6180 6003 - 2D Graphics Mark 386 248 227 - 3D Graphics Mark 888 888 884 - Memory Mark 2053 2492 2309 - Disk Mark 4084 20984 11886 Cinebench R23 - Single Core 919 918 789 - Multi Core 2862 2927 2541\n\nThe GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite performs quite well in benchmarks, but we can see at least two benchmarks where it performs slightly worse. The Lite mini PC performs about 7% slower in 3DMarks Fire Strike potentially because of using DDR4-3200 memory instead of DDR5-4800, and PassMark PerformanceTest 11 is lower because of poor Disk Mark score due to using a SATA SSD instead of an NVMe SSD. Note the 3D Graphics Mark score is exactly the same for the Mini Air12 and Mini Air12 Lite, so memory bandwidth did not impact this particular GPU test. The actively-cooled GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite is faster than the fanless MINIX NEO Z100-0dB in most of the tests, except the Memory Mark and Disk Mark in PassMark, and 3Dmark Fire Strike.\n\nNetwork performance (Gigabit Ethernet and WiFi 6)\n\nEthernet and WiFi networking performance was tested using the iperf3 utility, a Xiaomi AX6000 WiFi 6 router and 2.5 GbE TP-Link switch, and the UP Xtreme i11 mini PC on the other side of the connection,\n\nHere are the results for the gigabit Ethernet port:\n\nDownload\n\nPS C:\\Users\\aey\\downloads\\iperf3.17.1_64\\iperf3.17.1_64> .\\iperf3.exe -t 60 -c 192.168.31.12 -i 10 -R Connecting to host 192.168.31.12, port 5201 Reverse mode, remote host 192.168.31.12 is sending [ 5] local 192.168.31.122 port 49933 connected to 192.168.31.12 port 5201 [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [ 5] 0.00-10.01 sec 1.11 GBytes 949 Mbits/sec [ 5] 10.01-20.00 sec 1.10 GBytes 947 Mbits/sec [ 5] 20.00-30.00 sec 1.11 GBytes 949 Mbits/sec [ 5] 30.00-40.00 sec 1.10 GBytes 948 Mbits/sec [ 5] 40.00-50.00 sec 1.10 GBytes 948 Mbits/sec [ 5] 50.00-60.00 sec 1.11 GBytes 949 Mbits/sec -

It’s also much faster than the results we got for the Mini Air12, but at the time we were still using an older version of iperf3 severely impacting results in Windows, so results aren’t comparable.\n\nNote that the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite’s specifications list WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1, but as noted above, we have a WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 module installed in our sample. We’ve asked the company to confirm whether the specs are wrong, or we were given the wrong (and faster) module by mistake. [Update: Nov 18, 2024. The company replied:\n\nour first stock for Air12 Lite is Wifi 6E, but we’re going to standardize on Wifi5 for the back of the line.\n\n]\n\nThermal performance\n\nWe started testing cooling with 3DMark Fire Strike using HWiNFO64 to monitor the temperature and check for potential CPU throttling under a CPU+GPU workload. Neither thermal nor power throttling occurred and the temperature maxed out at 69°C. The Lite mini PC was quite cooler than the Mini Air12 which got up to 78°C in the same test.\n\nWe further stress-tested the CPU with Cinebench R23’s multi-core benchmark, and thermal throttling did not occur with CPU temperature topping at 71°C. However, HWiNFO64 did report power throttling. For reference, the Mini Air12 mini PC reached 82°C, but HWiNFO did not report any thermal or CPU throttling in Windows 11.\n\nOverall, the cooling solution of the Mini Air12 Lite appears to be improved over the Mini Air12 even though the latter was tested at 28°C to 30°C and the former at 26°C to 28°C.\n\nFan noise\n\nAs with most mini PCs we’ve reviewed recently, the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite is super quiet at idle or during light loads, and noisier under more demanding workloads. We measured the noise level with a sound level meter placed approximately 5 cm from the top case:\n\nNormal work, general web surfing – 38 – 40.3 dBA\n\n3DMark (Fire Strike) : 39.8 – 41.8 dBA\n\nCinebench R23 First 30 seconds – 40.1 – 41.5 dBA Afterwards – 47.0 – 49.1 dBA\n\n\n\nThe sound level meter measures 37-38 dBA in a quiet room.\n\nGEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite power consumption\n\nGEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite’s power consumption was measured in Windows 11 Pro with a wall power meter as follows:\n\nPower off – 1.2 to 1.3 Watts\n\nIdle – 5.8 – 6.2 Watts\n\nVideo playback – 10.9 to 15 watts (YouTube 8K 60fps in Chrome)\n\n3DMark Fire Strike – 13.1 to 22.2 Watts\n\nCinebench R23 First 30 seconds – 23.1 to 24.7 Watts Afterwards – 21.6 to 22.5 Watts\n\n\n\nNote: the mini PC was connected to WiFi 6, a USB keyboard, a USB mouse, and a GAOMON PD2200 drawing tablet through HDMI and its own power adapter.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite is a low-cost Intel N100 mini PC, it performed well in Windows 11 Pro with our review showing everything working up to expectation. We could play 4Kp60 and 8Kp60 YouTube videos smoothly, gigabit Ethernet worked fine, WiFI 6 performance was outstanding (but they’ll downgrade it to WiFi 5 for future production batches), and all six USB ports operated at the advertised speeds. We could also use it in dual display configuration connecting displays to its DisplayPort and HDMI video outputs. It’s also suitable for installation in a kiosk or cabinet thanks to its 9-pin expansion header providing access to external power and reset buttons and power and HDD LEDs, but it’s not something we tested.\n\nWith 8GB DDR4 memory and a 256GB M.2 SATA SSD in its default configuration, the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite mini PC is better suited for use cases like an HTPC, a Smart Home gateway/controller, or a kiosk, since 8GB of RAM is not ideal for multi-tasking and the SATA SSD is also smaller and slower than the NVMe SSD found in most mini PCs, so you can’t install a lot of programs and multi-tasking performance may suffer. However, while browsing the web with a few tabs open in Google Chrome, we did not notice any significant difference compared to other Alder Lake-N mini PCs equipped with faster NVMe storage. Fan noise is not excessive and idle power consumption is quite lower than for the original Mini Air12.\n\nSo all-in-all, we’re pretty satisfied with the GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite, at least in Windows 11 Pro, and the next step will be to test it in Linux with either Ubuntu 24.04.1 or Ubuntu 24.10. We’d like to thank GEEKOM for sending the Mini Air12 Lite mini PC for review. It can be purchased on Amazon for $179.10 (after ticking the 10% off coupon) and GEEKOM US for $179 with the coupon code “Air12Lite20” valid until November 20. British users can also find it on GEEKOM UK for 199 GBP, and the company has shops in other countries too. While it’s a low-cost mini PC compared to the Mini Air12, it’s not the cheapest Intel N100 mini PC around, and for instance, you’ll find the GMKtec G3 in a similar configuration for about $100 on AliExpress or $128 on Amazon. One advantage of purchasing a GEEKOM mini PC is that they ship from a local warehouse so they can offer free 30-day returns/refunds and a 3-year warranty that can be taken advantage of if needed.\n\nCNXSoft: This review is a translation – with some edits and additional insights – of the original review on CNX Software Thailand by Suthinee Kerdkaew.\n\nJean-Luc started CNX Software in 2010 as a part-time endeavor, before quitting his job as a software engineering manager, and starting to write daily news, and reviews full time later in 2011.\n\nShare this:\n\nSupport CNX Software!

        "summary": "The GEEKOM Mini Air12 Lite is a budget-friendly mini PC powered by an Intel Processor N100 CPU, featuring 8GB DDR4 memory, a 256GB SATA SSD, and dual display outputs, with connectivity options including Gigabit Ethernet and WiFi 6E. In testing, it performed well under Windows 11 Pro, handling 4K and 8K video playback smoothly, and offering good network performance, although future models will downgrade to WiFi 5. The Mini Air12 Lite is suitable for use as an HTPC, smart home controller, or kiosk, but its 8GB RAM and slower SATA SSD may limit multitasking capabilities compared to models with NVMe SSDs. The device's cooling system is effective, keeping temperatures lower than its predecessor, and it operates quietly under most conditions. Available for purchase on Amazon and GEEKOM's website, it offers a 3-year warranty and free returns, though it faces competition from cheaper alternatives like the GMKtec G3.",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Taking Wall Street By Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other AI news updates taking Wall Street by storm.\n\nxAI, the AI startup owned by Elon Musk, is raising more than $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, per a report by news platform CNBC. The bulk of this money, nearly $5 billion, will be raised through sovereign funds in the Middle East. The funding will be used to purchase 100,000 NVIDIA chips, according to the news outlet. xAI plans to build a supercomputer with these chips. This supercomputer would then be integrated with other Musk companies, most notably Tesla, as plans to improve Full Self Driving continue at a rapid pace.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nCNBC claims that the billionaire has started working closely with Donald Trump, the president-elect, on the approach of the new White House administration to AI and tech more broadly. Trump plans on rebranding the CHIPS Act and repealing the Executive Order on AI, two major AI initiatives of US President Joe Biden. The technology world has been dealing with the impact of a change in the US presidency, as Trump is widely expected to increase tariffs on firms doing business with China. He is also expected to urge tech firms in the country to relocate manufacturing operations from overseas to the US.\n\nREAD ALSO: 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "publish_date": "2024-11-17T23:00:18Z",
        "content": "Finding out where your gaming PC might be falling short is trickier than you think. Simply looking at Task Manager's report of CPU and GPU usage only gives you a limited glimpse into what might be your bottleneck, but is certainly not conclusive.\nIn their quest to further bolster the GPU side of their business, Intel produced a user-friendly version of the PresentMon process, which is a tool used to measure critical performance metrics outside the basics found in Task Manager. Here are 5 reasons why it's far more powerful than other system monitors for finding PC bottlenecks.\n7 things that could be causing your PC to bottleneck\nNothing is more annoying than losing performance, especially when it can be avoided. Here are some things to check if you're having issues.\n5 \"GPU Busy\" is a great metric for measuring bottlenecks\nAllows you to see if your CPU is lagging behind\nIt's actually uncommon for games to put a full load on both the CPU and GPU; most lean one way or the other, and users often become GPU or CPU bound. This means that either component could be holding back the other from pushing out more frames. This is where the metric of \"GPU busy\" comes in. For some quick background, \"frametime\" is the measure of how long it takes for what is happening in your game to make it to your screen, measured in milliseconds (ms). GPU busy takes that frametime metric and isolates the GPU processing time only, and Intel PresentMon gives you a nifty graph to see the delta between the two.\nIn the screenshot above, I've loaded up Escape From Tarkov, which is an FPS game that loves CPUs with good single-core performance and feasts on the CPU's cache. This illustrates perfectly why you shouldn't rely on GPU and CPU usage percentages alone. My CPU and GPU usage are both darting around 40%, which may give the impression that they're both being utilized equally, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\nWhen you look at the frametime average versus the GPU busy average, you see a very different story. It does not take my GPU very long to produce frames, only about 4 ms, but it waits a significant amount of time to receive those frames, resulting in lower FPS. In other words, my system has a CPU bottleneck when playing this game under these conditions.\nHere I've loaded up Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to illustrate this point further. I've cranked the settings to Ultra to make sure I'm GPU bound this time, and as you can see, my GPU busy time aligns with the total frametime. This tells us that there's no CPU bottleneck, and my GPU is being consistently fed with frames to render. Instead of relying on usage percentages only, GPU busy allows you to see what part of your system is actually overloaded.\n4 Cross-platform support\nAMD and NVIDIA users, rejoice!\nDespite it having \"Intel\" in the name, it's not exclusive to Intel platforms. NVIDIA and Radeon GPUs can both be monitored by Intel PresentMon. AMD processor support is also included, so nobody on the Red Team feels left out. There have been some reports on the GitHub page of users not being able to see their CPU telemetry on Ryzen systems, but this seems to have been resolved.\nAfter only one year of use, my Intel Core i9-14900K has deteriorated to the point that it's unusable\nI'm shocked things have gotten so bad.\n3 Capture data without an overlay\nBulk collection made incredibly easy\nIntel PresentMon is also able to capture data while the overlay is hidden. You can set how long you want the capture to be and set a hotkey to begin data capture. Data is captured in the .csv format and can be viewed in your spreadsheet application of choice. You might not be bottlenecked as much in some games compared to others, so collecting data might be useful for you.\nHow to bring your Excel data to life with dynamic visualizations\nCaptivate your audience with dynamic Excel charts\n2 Comprehensive list of system metrics to track\nAll the key telemetry is monitored and displayed\nBesides GPU busy, Intel PresentMon can track a laundry list of system metrics. There are some preset modes, like \"Basic\" and \"Power/Temp\" which focus on specific metrics, but the most useful one to me is \"GPU Focus.\" GPU focus has the GPU busy metric front and center. If that's not enough for you, you can customize the overlay to feature essentially anything you want to measure, along with the color of the graphs.\n1 It's an open-source utility\nThere are some applications that work really well alongside it\nOne of my personal favorite things about Intel PresentMon is the open-source nature of it. Because its source code is available, other applications have been made to interface with it easily. For example, AMD's OCAT (Open Capture Analysis Tool) is actually based on Intel PresentMon's libraries. If you need to capture graphs of frametimes and analyze potential stuttering, CapFrameX, which is pictured above, is a great tool for doing exactly that and is based directly on Intel PresentMon.\nThe 20 best open-source alternatives to popular software on Windows\nNot everyone wants to trust big corporations, and these open-source Windows programs give the power back to the community.\nDon't rely on just one tool\nTask Manager and other performance measuring tools can only tell you bits and pieces of the story. Before going out and splashing cash on a new piece of hardware, it's important to make sure you're replacing the right component in your rig. Otherwise, you risk being even more limited in your performance than you were before.",

        "content": "While Intel's primary product focus is on the processors, or brains, that make computers work, system memory (that's DRAM) is a critical component for performance. This is especially true in servers, where the multiplication of processing cores has outpaced the rise in memory bandwidth (in other words, the memory bandwidth available per core has fallen). In heavy-duty computing jobs like weather modeling, computational fluid dynamics and certain types of AI, this mismatch could create a bottleneck—until now.After several years of development with industry partners, Intel engineers have found a path to open that bottleneck, crafting a novel solution that has created the fastest system memory ever and is set to become a new open industry standard. The recently introduced Intel Xeon 6 data center processors are the first to benefit from this new memory, called MRDIMMs, for higher performance—in the most plug-and-play manner imaginable.Intel's Bhanu Jaiswal, Xeon product manager in Intel's Data Center and AI (DCAI) group, explains that \"a significant percentage of high-performance computing workloads are memory-bandwidth bound,\" the kind most set to benefit from MRDIMMs. It sounds almost too good to be true—here's the story behind the DDR5 Multiplexed Rank Dual Inline Memory Module, or MRDIMM for storytelling efficiency.It turns out the most common memory modules used for data center jobs, known as RDIMMs, do have parallel resources on board, like modern processors do. They're just not used that way.\"Most DIMMs have two ranks for performance and capacity,\" says George Vergis, a senior principal engineer in memory pathfinding in DCAI. \"It's the sweet spot.\"You can think of ranks like, well, banks - one set of memory chips on a module would belong to one and the rest to the other rank. With RDIMMs, data can be stored and accessed across multiple ranks independently but not simultaneously.Considering this situation, recalls Vergis, \"We're like, 'Wait a minute. We've got parallel resources that are unused. Why can't we put them together?'\" The idea that Vergis pursued was to put a small interface chip - a multiplexer or \"mux\"—on the DRAM module. It allows data to flow across both ranks of memory in the same unit of time.The mux buffer consolidates each MRDIMM's electrical load, which allows the interface to operate at a higher speed compared to RDIMMs. And now that both ranks of memory can be accessed in parallel, its bandwidth has doubled.The result is the fastest system memory ever created—by a leap that would normally take several generations of memory technologies to achieve (in this case, peak bandwidth rises by almost 40%, from 6,400 megatransfers per second (MT/s) to 8,800 MT/s).At this point you might have your own \"wait a minute\" question: Is Intel getting back into the memory business? No. Although Intel started as a memory company and invented technologies including EPROM and DRAM, the company has exited its various memory product businesses over its history (some quite famously).But Intel never stopped the \"lifts all boats\" efforts that make different computing components interoperable and higher performing. Vergis represents Intel on the board of JEDEC, which sets open standards for the microelectronics industry, most notably for memory. Vergis earned a JEDEC award in 2018 for his work on the DDR5 standard, and right now he's devoting time to DDR6. (JEDEC also honored Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger this year for a career as \"a strong proponent of open standards as evidenced by Intel's historic leadership in developing standards.\")Vergis and his cohorts started this work in 2018 and proved the concept with prototypes by 2021. Intel teamed up with the memory ecosystem to build the first components, and donated the specs to JEDEC as a new open standard in late 2022.What stands out about the MRDIMM is its ease of use. It employs the same connector and form factor as a regular RDIMM (even the little mux chips fit in previously empty spots on the module), thus requiring no changes in the motherboard.MRDIMMs also bring along all the same error-correcting and reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) features as RDIMMs. Data integrity is maintained no matter how separate requests might be multiplexed across the data buffer, Vergis explains.This all means data center customers can choose MRDIMMs when they order a new server, or later they can slide that server out of the rack and swap the RDIMMs for new MRDIMMs. Not a single line of code needs to change to enjoy newfound performance.What is required is a CPU that can work with MRDIMMs, and the first one available is the Intel Xeon 6 processor with Performance-cores, code-named Granite Rapids, which came to market this year.Recent independent tests compared two identical Xeon 6 systems, one with MRDIMMs and the other with RDIMMs. The system with MRDIMMs completed jobs as much as 33% faster.Jaiswal says the \"improvement in bandwidth that MRDIMM delivers is very much applicable to small language models and traditional deep learning and recommendation system types of AI workloads that can easily run on Xeon and achieve a good performance boost with MRDIMM.\"Leading memory vendors have introduced MRDIMMs, with additional memory makers expected to launch more. High-performance computing labs - such as the National Institute for Quantum Science and Technology and National Institute for Fusion Science, among others - are actively adopting Xeon 6 with P-cores because of MRDIMMs, with support from OEMs like NEC.\"Intel definitely has a lead,\" Jaiswal notes, \"backed by a strong ecosystem of OEMs and memory vendors.\"",

        "content": "Yesterday, we reported that Intel might be gearing up to unleash Battlemage early in December - ahead of AMD's RDNA 4 and Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs. Today, a shipping manifest at NBD - highlighted by user josefk972 at X indicates that Team Blue has been dispatching what appears to be GPU boxes for a never-before-seen \"BMG B580\" card - likely referring to the Arc B580 based on Battlemage.\n\nPer our testing, while a GPU's retail box is probably the least likely thing you'd expect in a pre-launch leak, it does highlight that Intel is hard at work shipping these boxes to OEMs. Battlemage, or Xe2, first debuted with Intel's Lunar Lake chips and stood firm against AMD's Strix Point offerings. The drivers have improved greatly—at least when compared to Alchemist—but a few kinks still need ironing.\n\nIt seems this manifest slipped from our eyes as it dates back to September 18. Intel has been sending out packing or retail boxes - measuring around 192mm x 89mm x 381mm for the Arc B580 - a budget offering from the Battlemage lineup. The packaging is relatively small but should be enough to accommodate a compact dual-slot GPU.\n\n(Image credit: NBD via josefk972\n\nWe are still unaware of the specifications, although Battlemage is rumored to feature three GPUs: Arc BMG-31, Arc BMG-20, and Arc BMG-G10. The BMG-31 reportedly offers 32 Xe cores, netting us 256 Xe Vector Engines or 4096 ALUs.\n\nIntel will target the budget gaming segment, like AMD, with Xe2 on the desktop to penetrate the mainstream market better. Team Blue needs some serious value and incentives to win the average consumer's trust, such as higher VRAM capacities and competitive pricing. Initial leaks paint a positive picture as a 20-Xe2 core dGPU (Dedicated GPU) beat the 28-Xe core-based Arc A750 in a benchmark recently. RDNA 4 will likely be the more mature architecture as it builds upon RDNA 3.5 - Battlemage's competitor and is poised to make substantial changes in the RT department and AI capabilities.\n\nWith more leaks surfacing daily, Battlemage's potential announcement next month seems likely, but we still advise users to take this rumor with a pinch of salt. It makes sense for Intel to capitalize on the holiday season and make hay while the sun shines, but for this to transpire, it must be able to offer Battlemage in volume—at least until RDNA 4 and Blackwell hit shelves.",
        "summary": "Intel is reportedly preparing to release its Battlemage GPUs, potentially as early as December, ahead of AMD's RDNA 4 and Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs. A shipping manifest suggests Intel is dispatching boxes for a new \"BMG B580\" card, likely part of the Battlemage lineup, indicating active preparations for launch. Battlemage, which debuted with Intel's Lunar Lake chips, has shown improvements over previous models, though some issues remain. The lineup is expected to target the budget gaming segment, with rumors of three GPUs featuring varying Xe core counts, aiming to offer competitive pricing and higher VRAM capacities. While leaks suggest a possible announcement soon, it's advised to remain cautious, as Intel needs to ensure sufficient volume to capitalize on the holiday season before competitors release their new products.",

        "content": "Industrial AI startup Juna.ai raises $7.5M in seed funding\nJuna.ai GmbH, a German startup using artificial intelligence to make factories more efficient, launched today with $7.5 million in seed funding.\nKleiner Perkins led the investment. It was joined by Stockholm-based fund Norrsken VC, prominent venture capitalist John Doerr and other backers.\nJuna.ai is led by Chief Executive Matthias Auf der Mauer, whose previous industrial software startup was acquired by publicly traded sensor maker Sensirion Holding AG. Co-founder Christian Hardenberg, the company’s chief technology officer, previously held the same role at Delivery Hero SE. Juna.ai provides a hosted AI platform that promises to help manufacturers find ways of operating their production lines more efficiently.\nThe company’s platform integrates with applications from SAP SE, Snowflake Inc. and other enterprise software providers. It uses those integrations to collect technical data such as equipment temperature readings from customers’ plants. From there, Juna.ai’s AI algorithms turn the raw data into dashboards that highlight areas for improvement in a factory’s operations.\nSome of the platform’s features focus on helping manufacturers boost production reliability. Juna.ai can measure the number of products that a factory produces per day, the frequency at which manufacturing defects emerge and related metrics. The software also generates improvement recommendations.\nReducing factories’ energy usage is another task to which customers can apply Juna.ai’s platform. For manufacturers that produce multiple types of goods, the software breaks down electricity usage by product. Juna.ai also identifies situations where a production line consumes more power than usual and provides technical data that can be used for troubleshooting.\nAccording to the company, customers can use the information produced by its platform to bring their plants into compliance with the ISO 50001 standard. This is a collection of best practices designed to help manufacturers cut their electricity usage. Additionally, Juna.ai turns the power consumption data it collects into reports that can be used to demonstrate compliance with manufacturing regulations.\nUnder the hood, the platform is powered by custom AI models. The company says that it developed its models using a method known as reinforcement learning. Neural networks based on this technology are trained through trial and error: They perform a task repeatedly to learn the best way of completing it and receive positive feedback after each learning milestone.\nJuna.ai fine-tunes its models on customers’ data to produce AI agents. Those are customized neural networks that can perform tasks with little to no human input. According to Juna.ai, each of its agents is designed to monitor and optimize a different set of industrial metrics.\nThe company currently has six employees. Juna.ai will use the newly announced seed round to hire more staffers and grow its customer base.\nPhoto: Unsplash\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Thousands of American kids are being sent to camps run by a Chinese influence and intelligence agency that promote Chinese Communist Party propaganda and even train some children to act like “Little Overseas Chinese Police,” a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation discovered.\n\nThe Chinese government advertises the “Root-Seeking Summer Camp In China” as an opportunity for ethnically Chinese children living in the U.S. and other countries to immerse themselves in the Chinese language and culture. However, a Daily Caller News Foundation review of Chinese government announcements and the program’s website discovered the camps are overseen by a Chinese influence and intelligence service.\n\nThe program not only exposes participants as young as 10 years old to CCP propaganda, but some even operate like boot camps run by officers from the People’s Liberation Army and the Ministry of Public Security, Chinese government social media posts reveal.\n\n“The long arm of the CCP’s malign influence extends into the United States and seeks to assert an illegitimate claim on all those of Chinese ancestry—regardless of their nationality,” Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n“We need to protect all those on American soil from the CCP’s authoritarian agenda, particularly by educating the American public on the true nature of the Party and its dystopian vision,” said Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the CCP.\n\n‘Little Overseas Chinese Police’\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found multiple examples of Chinese American children attending “root-seeking” camps run by Chinese security and military personnel.\n\nIn August 2016, over 50 children from the U.S., Canada, Portugal, and other countries participated in an eight-day camp in and around the city of Suqian in China’s eastern Jiangsu province, according to a social media post from that city’s Foreign Affairs Office.\n\nAmong other activities, the social media post states that the children trained at the Jiangsu National Defense Education and Training Center in Suzhou, which is a roughly 62-acre military base featuring obstacle courses and field combat training areas, according to a local government website. Photos from the camp show two Chinese soldiers wearing fatigues alongside a group of several dozen participants standing in front of a “Jacob’s Ladder” obstacle course.\n\nThe following year, campers from the U.S. and the United Kingdom donned matching green shirts and camouflage shorts during two days of military training in Beijing, according to a social media post made by the training center. Photos from the July 2017 camp show the children marching, saluting, doing pushups, and standing at parade rest under the watchful eye of People’s Liberation Army soldiers. Other photos show participants smiling and hugging the soldiers.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported that the Chinese military has been conducting “National Defense Education” within Chinese kindergartens for years. Along with learning drill commands, the weeklong boot camps also familiarize kindergarteners with a wide variety of toy weapons, including knives, rifles, grenades, mortars, and shoulder-fired missiles.\n\nThis summer Chinese kindergarteners are practicing \"rifle tactics\" and running around playing squad-based skirmish games shooting each other at National Defense Education boot camps that @Dailycaller reported on\n\n\n\nWatch this video: pic.twitter.com/FkubmCC9O4 — Philip Lenczycki ?? (@LenczyckiPhilip) July 10, 2023\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation discovered another “root-seeking” camp overseen by China’s national police authority, the Ministry of Public Security.\n\nIn July 2019, over 1,000 overseas Chinese children from the U.S. and other countries took part in a series of camps spread throughout the city of Wenzhou in China’s eastern Zhejiang province, Chinese-language media outlet Sohu reported.\n\nParticipants in at least one of the camps trained alongside Ministry of Public Security officers at a police station in the city’s Li’Ao subdistrict, according to an announcement from the provincial All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, which the Department of Justice identifies as an “agency” of a Chinese influence and intelligence service called the United Front Work Department.\n\nCamp participants wore matching black T-shirts featuring the English word “POLICE” as well as matching hats bearing a Ministry of Public Security badge, photos show.\n\nDuring the program’s convocation ceremony, Ministry of Public Security and All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese officials inducted the children into a squad of “Little Overseas Chinese Police,” saying they hoped the new cadets would “guide more overseas Chinese youth to join the ranks of the Little Overseas Chinese Police,” All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese’s report states.\n\nAfterward, Ministry of Public Security officials showed the children the police station’s “intelligence room” as well as a room dedicated to recruiting and training CCP members, All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese reported.\n\nBrandon Weichert, a national security analyst at the National Interest, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the “Little Overseas Chinese Police” camp may aim to threaten participants into operating as informants.\n\n“We’re always watching you,” Weichert said, “why don’t you help us keep tabs on mom and dad or grandma and grandpa or brother and sister?”\n\n(Image created by the Daily Caller News Foundation with screenshots from Chinese government social media accounts)\n\n‘Get Them While They’re Young’\n\nThe Chinese government’s “root-seeking” camp program was jointly launched by the State Council’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and its China Overseas Exchange Association in 1999, according to an announcement on the New York Chinese Consulate website. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office officially became a United Front Work Department bureau in 2018, Chinese government records show.\n\nIn 2001, the “root-seeking” program welcomed 3,000 participants from over 40 countries and grew to over 6,000 participants from 51 countries by 2010, according to Chinese state-run media.\n\nThe number of participants nearly doubled by 2018, according to a New York Chinese Consulate announcement from that year.\n\n“Every year, over 10,000 overseas Chinese teenagers from around the globe are invited to come to China to visit, inspect, study and communicate, seeking their roots from their ancestors,” the consulate announcement reads.\n\nChinese government social media posts show the camps are held in megacities, like Shanghai, as well as in remote provinces, including Xinjiang, where the U.S. government says the CCP is committing genocide against Uyghur and other ethnic minorities.\n\nSalih Hudayar, the East Turkistan Government-In-Exile’s minister for foreign affairs and security, described the CCP’s program as a “calculated attempt to whitewash its brutal policies.”\n\n“By inviting overseas Chinese youth to participate in these state-orchestrated tours, Beijing seeks to mask its ongoing Uyghur Genocide, reshaping global perceptions to reinforce a false narrative over our homeland,” Hudayar told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This program is not a genuine cultural exchange, but a means of manufacturing support for China’s occupation and colonization.”\n\nAlthough the camps’ itineraries vary depending on location, a Daily Caller News Foundation review found they regularly include cultural activities such as practicing calligraphy or kung fu as well as stops at local attractions like the Great Wall of China or Giant Panda Sanctuaries.\n\nYet, regardless of where in China the camps are held, the sightseeing always involves “Red Tourism,” which state-run media outlet China Daily has described as visiting locations “related to the nation’s revolutionary history.”\n\nIn recent years, participants have “experienced Red culture” by studying revolutionary martyrs, by delivering flowers to Mao Zedong’s statue, or by dressing in military uniforms at the “birthplace of the Red Army,” Chinese government social media posts show.\n\nOpening and closing ceremonies overseen by high-level United Front Work Department personnel are another commonality between the camps, with many even featuring special stops in Beijing to attend functions at the Chinese government’s Great Hall of the People.\n\nDuring the program’s 2010 opening ceremony in Beijing, China’s vice president at the time, Xi Jinping, delivered a speech broadly outlining the program’s purpose, Chinese government records show.\n\n“Uniting together as one Chinese people is the shared ‘root,'” Xi said at the event, according to a government report, “the wide-ranging and profound Chinese culture is the shared ‘soul,’ and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the shared ‘dream’ of Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad.”\n\nXi urged participants to become “enthusiastic disseminators” of Chinese culture, “active promoters” of cultural exchange, as well as “emissaries” for friendly contact between China and other nations, according to the government report.\n\nThe “root-seeking” program now closely follows Xi’s theoretical framework, and the Daily Caller News Foundation found multiple government announcements from the summer of 2024 reporting camps had trained participants to become “Chinese culture ambassadors” and to “tell China’s story well”—which is CCP terminology for conducting “external propaganda work,” according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\n“The legitimate rights for overseas Chinese to learn and inherit their own language and culture should be respected and protected,” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the U.S., told the Daily Caller News Foundation by email. “The Root-Seeking Summer Camp in China provides a platform to help overseas Chinese learn their native language, understand their culture, and go to their ancestral country, China, to seek their roots and to study and exchange in China.”\n\n“The Root-Seeking Summer Camp has always been conducted in accordance with international laws and the laws and customs of the country where the overseas Chinese live,” Liu added. “The Root-Seeking Summer Camp not only satisfies the needs of overseas Chinese to learn their own language and culture, but also effectively promotes exchanges and integration between different cultures around the world, and provides convenience for the world to understand China and for China to understand the world.”\n\nHowever, the embassy refused to address questions concerning whether or not the program was connected to the United Front Work Department.\n\nNational security analyst Weichert told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the program aims to “get them while they’re young.”\n\n“What this is all about is forming cadres of sympathizers for the CCP, so that they’ll then come back to the U.S. and they’ll serve the interests of the CCP, whether wittingly or unwittingly,” Weichert said. “No country is going to put resources into a program like that unless there was some kind of ulterior motive.”\n\n(Image created by the Daily Caller News Foundation with screenshots from Chinese government social media and Xungen Association of Chinese-Americans Inc. website)\n\n‘Unrestricted Warfare’\n\nThe Chinese Embassy and consulates in the U.S. rely on a network of Chinese American organizations to recruit children for the “root-seeking” camps, according to Chinese government and civic association records.\n\nThe so-called Overseas Chinese Service Centers in the U.S. are among those involved in recruiting for the “root-seeking” program, according to their websites, Chinese state-run media reports, and government announcements.\n\nThe United Front Work Department oversees a global network of approximately 60 Overseas Chinese Service Centers, which include seven U.S. branches located in California, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Missouri, the Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported.\n\nOne year before campers trained to become “Little Overseas Chinese Police” in Wenzhou, leaders of Overseas Chinese Service Centers from the U.S. and other countries met with Ministry of Public Security officials at the very same Li’Ao subdistrict police station in January 2018, the Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported.\n\nDuring that 2018 meeting, Ministry of Public Security officials showed the Overseas Chinese Service Center leaders how the Wenzhou police station’s “Extraterritorial Video Trial Court” works with “Overseas Chinese Police Contact Points” housed in some Overseas Chinese Service Centers to conduct “cross-border remote justice services,” the Daily Caller News Foundation reported.\n\nOverseas Chinese Service Center emissaries also posed with Ministry of Public Security officers outside the Wenzhou police station in the same spot where the “Little Overseas Chinese Police” cadets would later be photographed alongside Ministry of Public Security officers in 2019, Chinese government photos show.\n\nHowever, Overseas Chinese Service Centers are not the only Chinese American organizations recruiting participants for the “root-seeking” camps.\n\nA 2018 announcement from the New York Chinese Consulate identifies over a dozen Chinese American organizations recruiting for the program on the East Coast alone.\n\nOne New York-based group, Xungen Association of Chinese-Americans Inc., claims to have recruited nearly 2,000 children for the program since 2013. In July 2024, All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese appointed that association’s chairwoman as an adviser while she was leading a group of campers through Quanzhou, Fujian.\n\nAnother large U.S. recruiter is an Ann Arbor, Michigan, nonprofit called the Chinese School Association in the U.S., which describes itself as “the largest grass-root organization for Chinese Americans.”\n\n“Every year, the association hosts and organizes China’s ‘Roots-Seeking Tour’ summer camp,” Chinese School Association in the U.S.’ website states.\n\nChinese School Association in the U.S.’ board includes the head of the St. Louis, Missouri, Overseas Chinese Service Center, who in 2018 was among the U.S. service center leaders that met with Ministry of Public Security officials in Wenzhou. In light of its Chinese government ties, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey recently subpoenaed the St. Louis Overseas Chinese Service Center.\n\n“The CCP embeds itself in our universities, critical infrastructure, and government through elite capture operations and establishes so-called ‘service centers’ that are linked to the CCP’s intel arm to extend its influence,” Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n“The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is waging an all-out war against the United States—not with missiles or bombs, but with a sophisticated and insidious strategy of unrestricted warfare to infiltrate, weaken, and ultimately destroy our nation from within,” said Burlison, a member of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nXungen and the Chinese School Association in the U.S. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nOriginally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation",

        "content": "AWS App Studio launches in general availability, making everyone an app builder\nAmazon Web Services Inc. today announced the general availability of AWS App Studio, its popular artificial intelligence service for creating business applications with natural language prompts.\nFirst announced as a preview in July, AWS App Studio is a generative AI-powered app development tool that makes it possible for users to simply describe what kind of application that they want to build, in their natural language, and then immediately have it built. It requires no coding skills at all.\nThe tool is there to help workers create internal software tools more quickly. A marketing team might use it to create an application for managing creative assets used in their ad campaigns, or an information technology team might want to build an app that tracks ticket requests for employee’s workstations.\nIn a blog post, AWS developer advocate Donnie Prakoso explained that AWS App Studio is all about empowering everyone to become an app builder. “Whether you are an IT Project Manager, Data Engineer, Enterprise Architect, or Solution Architect, simply describe your requirements in natural language, and within minutes, App Studio generates fully functional applications complete with multipage UIs, data models, and custom business logic,” he wrote.\nTo get started, users can enter a simple text prompt, describing what kind of app they want to build. That could be a simple, one-sentence description of the app, saying what it will be used for, or a more detailed overview that outlines different features the user wants to see.\nApp Studio then generates a detailed list of the features and suggestions for the app’s interface. Users can review this list, and add new features or tweak the interface with additional prompts. Once the user is satisfied, App Studio will take a few minutes to build the new application. Then, once the initial version is ready, users have the opportunity to customize its interface using drag-and-drop tools, so they can easily add or remove different elements.\nOther features include the ability to integrate the AI-generated app with external services. So a revenue tracking app might be configured to pull sales data from a system such as Salesforce, or Amazon’s S3 storage repository.\nFinally, users will get to test the app works as intended, before deploying it in production with a few simple clicks. Once the app is deployed, App Studio will create a dedicated URL to access it. For security, there are role-based access controls that can be applied, so only authorized employees are allowed to use the app.\nWith AWS App Studio’s official launch, it’s getting a few interesting updates, Prakoso said. One of the most interesting is the ability to modify existing applications with natural language commands. Once an app has been generated and deployed, users will be able to update it at will using additional natural language prompts. They go to the app chatbot and describe the changes they want to make, and after seeing what the change looks like, the user simply confirms the update.\nAmazon has also introduced the ability to make applications more intelligent by adding generative AI capabilities such as text summarization, content generation and file analysis. In addition, users can now generate and add custom business logic using their natural language, and customize the app’s theme and style, for instance by switching to a Light mode or Dark mode, or else a specific color that matches their company’s branding.\nPrakoso said AWS App Studio is generally available now in Amazon’s US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) AWS regions, with more regions to come in future.\nThe company positions AWS App Studio as a more economical alternative to existing low-code application development tools, and in fact, it is entirely free to use. Customers only have to pay for the time employees spend using the applications it generates, and the company claims this makes it up to 80% more affordable than rival services.\nWhat’s more, new customers will be able to use their newly generated applications for free for the first 60 days, the company said.\nImages: AWS\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Nvidia launches H200 NVL high-performance GPU to power AI supercomputing\nNvidia Corp. today announced the availability of its newest data center-grade graphics processing unit, the H200 NVL, to power artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.\nThe company announced its new PCIe form factor card during the SC24 high-performance computing conference in Atlanta alongside a bevy of updates to enable high-performance AI for scientific research and engineering.\nThe H200 NVL is the latest addition to Nvidia’s Hopper family of GPUs designed for data centers running on lower-power, air-cooled racks. According to the company, about 70% of enterprise data center floors run at 20,000-kilowatt hours and below, which allows for air cooling. This makes PCIe GPUs essential for flexibility, since they don’t require specialized cooling systems.\nThe new GPU provides a 1.5-times memory efficiency increase and 1.2-times bandwidth increase over the H100 NVL, the company said, and businesses can use it to fine-tune large language models within a few hours with up to 1.7-times faster performance when deployed.\nThe University of Mexico said it has tapped Nvidia’s accelerated computing technology for scientific research and academic applications.\n“As a public research university, our commitment to AI enables the university to be on the forefront of scientific and technological advancements,” said Prof. Patrick Bridges, director of the UNM Center for Advanced Research Computing. “As we shift to H200 NVL, we’ll be able to accelerate a variety of applications, including data science initiatives, bioinformatics and genomics research, physics and astronomy simulations, climate modeling and more.”\nTo help build on and accelerate the use of AI in scientific research, Nvidia announced the release of the open-source Nvidia BioNeMo framework to assist with drug discovery and molecule design. The platform accelerated computing tools to scale up AI models for biomolecular research to bring supercomputing to biopharma engineering.\n“The convergence of AI, accelerated computing and expanding datasets offers unprecedented opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry, as evidenced by recent Nobel Prize wins in chemistry,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at Nvidia.\nAI has quickly emerged as a potent discovery mechanism for new chemicals and materials. To explore potential materials within the nearly infinite combinations Nvidia announced ALCHEMI which allows researchers to optimize AI models via an NIM microservice. These microservices enable users to deploy prebuilt foundation models in the cloud, data center or workstations.\nUsing ALCHEMI, researchers can test chemical compounds and materials in a simulated virtual AI lab without the need to spend extra time trying and failing to build structures in an actual lab. According to Nvidia, the new microservices can be run on an H100 using a pretrained model for materials chemistry testing for long-term stability 100 times faster than with the NIM off. For example, evaluating 16 million structures could take months, with the microservice it would take mere hours.\nExtreme weather also presents a problem for scientists, which is why Nvidia announced two new NIM microservices for Earth-2, a platform used for simulating and visualizing weather and climate conditions. With this technology, climate researchers can use AI assistance to forecast extreme weather events – from local to global occurrences.\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, natural disasters have been responsible for around $62 billion in insured losses during the first half of 2024, or about 70% more than the 10-year average. This included increasing wildfires and severe thunderstorms across the United States with even more costly storms and torrential flooding in Europe.\nNvidia is releasing CorDiff NIM and ForCastNet NIM, which will help weather technology companies build high-resolution and accurate predictions.\nCorDiff uses generative AI at kilometer-scale resolution for weather forecasting. Nvidia used the model’s capability to gain better-localized predictions and analysis of typhoons over Taiwan earlier this year. CorDiff was trained on the Weather Research and Forecasting model’s numerical simulation to generate patterns at 12 times higher resolution. According to Nvidia CorDiff NIM runs 500 times faster and is 100,000 times more energy efficient than traditional prediction using central processing units.\nFourCastNet provides global, medium-range, lower-resolution forecasts for systems that don’t need highly localized information. For example, if a provider wants to get an idea of what might happen across the next two weeks given current conditions, FourCastNet can provide a forecast 5,000 times faster than traditional numerical weather models.\nImage: Nvidia\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Cerebras Systems upgrades its inference service with record performance for Meta’s largest LLM model\nCerebras Systems Inc., an ambitious artificial intelligence computing startup and rival chipmaker to Nvidia Corp., said today that its cloud-based AI large language model inference service can run Meta Platforms Inc.’s largest model at almost 1,000 tokens per second.\nInference is the process trained AI models use to apply logic and algorithms to streaming data to draw conclusions and make “inferences” or predictions about what will come next. It’s essentially the decision-making portion of AI deployment. The number of tokens that can be fed through an AI per second determines the speed at which it can think and respond.\nThe company launched its inference service in August, claiming it could run up to 16 times faster than comparable cloud-based services that use Nvidia’s most powerful graphical processing units. According to Cerebras, it delivers 2,100 tokens per second for Llama 3.1 70B performance.\nThe current system can deliver the much more complex Meta Llama 3.1 405B at lightning-fast 969 tokens per second. According to Cerebras, this places the super-giant frontier model on par with ultra-tiny models, which can run at almost instant speeds.\nThe 405B means that the model has 405 billion parameters, or variables that can be used to configure how an AI model processes data. The larger the number of parameters, the more proficient it can be made for making accurate and high-quality results. Bigger, more complex models also have a lot more momentum when processing, which makes them slower and that can affect user experience.\n“We can now run 405B faster than GPUs can run Llama 1B,” James Wang, director of product marketing at Cerebras, told SiliconANGLE in an interview. “Llama 1B, the tiniest Llama, runs at 550 tokens per second on the fastest solution measured so far, and we can take a model 405 times larger and run it at twice the speed.”\nThe company achieves these speeds because of the specialized architecture that it has built into its powerful custom silicon for AI and high-performance computing, or HPC, workload software stack. The company has landed a few headlines for the past year saying that its dinner-plate-sized chips are more powerful than those minted by Nvidia, but also more cost-efficient for AI training and now inference.\nAccording to the company, these speeds allow the open-source Llama 3.1 405B to outstrip closed-source frontier models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Anthropic PBC’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet by over 10x.\nFor a real-world comparison, the time difference in text-search latency, or the time it takes a query for the 405 billion parameter model to come back with an answer on the fastest GPU system benchmarked is about five seconds. Cerebras says that it can respond in 0.07 seconds, which for humans is almost instantaneous. For voice applications, which require less than 100 milliseconds to feel like natural human conversation, it can take 700 milliseconds on GPUs, and on Cerebras less than 10 milliseconds.\nPricing for Llama 3.1 405B will be $6 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens, around 25% cheaper than Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC and Microsoft Corp.’s Azure. Trials for the service are available today for customers and the company intends to make the service available in the first quarter of 2025.\nCerebas customers include generative AI video research company Tavus Inc., LiveKit, a company that provides the edge network that powers OpenAI’s voice mode capabilities, and multinational pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline PLC.\n“Using Llama models running on Cerebras Inference, GSK is developing innovative AI applications, such as intelligent research agents, that will fundamentally improve the productivity of our researchers and drug discovery process,” said Kim Branson, senior vice president of AI and machine learning at GSK.\nAlongside assisting with drug discovery, Cerebras announced that it achieved world-record performance in molecular dynamics simulation using its powerful hardware. According to the company, it has broken world records by running simulations 700x faster than Frontier, the world’s first and fastest exascale supercomputer. It even exceeded the performance of Anton 3, a custom supercomputer purpose-built for molecular dynamics.\nThese supercomputers are fundamental for discovering new materials that might become the next heat shielding for rockets sent into space, protection structures for nuclear reactors or specialized proteins for medicine. The capability to predict how they will behave far into the future with vast computing power makes them very valuable to scientists and engineers.\nUsing Cerebras hardware, scientists were able to simulate atomic activity into the future at 1.2 million timesteps per second, a first in molecular dynamics history according to the company. Frontier supercomputer averages 1,700 using 37,888 GPUs and Anton 3’s custom hardware reaches 980,000 using 512 custom chips.\nPhoto: Cerebras Systems\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Unlocking AI’s potential: Inference, scalability and sustainability in focus\nArtificial intelligence is reshaping the business landscape, with enterprise AI driving a shift from experimental models to actionable insights.\nAs organizations transition from training large language models to deploying AI in real-world scenarios, the focus has turned to unlocking proprietary data’s value, optimizing inference and addressing critical challenges, such as scalability, performance density and sustainability, according to Shimon Ben-David (pictured, left), chief technology officer of WekaIO Inc.\n“We’re future-proofing the environment by looking at where customers are actually going to be in the next two, three, four years and making sure that Weka can actually accommodate that,” Ben-David said. “We’re seeing how these large-scale AI projects in production, which are a year or two ahead of the market, even are doing things. We take that and we help customers accommodate for their new environments using that experience.”\nBen-David and Jonathan Martin (right), president of WekaIO, spoke with theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante for a special CUBE Conversation about AI’s second wave, as part of theCUBE’s SC24 pre-event coverage. They discussed how enterprise AI is transitioning from training LLMs to deploying scalable, sustainable solutions for real-world applications and what’s next for AI in 2025. (* Disclosure below.)\nFrom training to inference: Navigating the next wave\nAs AI continues to advance, enterprises are shifting their focus from the large-scale training of LLMs to inference. The accessibility of pre-trained LLMs is lowering the barriers to adoption, enabling organizations to implement AI at scale, according to Ben-David.\n“In the past you had to train your models and you had to have a whole practice of data scientists around it,” he said. “Today, it’s very easy to just take models, existing models, pre-trained LLMs and run them in your environment. Enterprises that will implement it are looking for an outcome and we’re seeing that going through 2025, they will actually look for a better ROI on their investment because they need to benefit from these LLMs and they need to do it in a way that actually allows them to get more revenue than not doing it.”\nThe rise of retrieval-augmented generation further illustrates the challenges enterprises face. While promising, RAG pipelines require significant know-how to transition from proof-of-concept to secure, scalable deployment. Companies such as Nvidia Corp. are streamlining these processes with tools such as NeMo, but the lack of established blueprints keeps organizations in an exploratory phase, according to Ben-David.\n“The way to do it is enterprises are now exploring whether to continue using or start using inferencing services as a service in cloud environments or maybe build their own enterprise inferencing environment in a GPU cloud or on-prem,” he said. “If they’re actually going to do it, how are they going to do it? We’re seeing Nvidia dominating that market. We’re seeing that trend increasing with maybe additional players coming into play.”\nLooking ahead: Enterprise AI and its transformative potential\nThe growing volume of enterprise data is driving the need for exascale computing, capable of performing quintillions of calculations per second. While this capability was once confined to supercomputing labs, it is now becoming a necessity for large corporations, Martin explained.\n“This is the year where exascale has become very real,” he said. “At the start of this year, we had no customers that were over an exabyte of storage capacity. We’ll end this year with five customers over an exabyte and one customer almost 10 exabytes.”\nSustainability also looms as a critical concern. Training AI models consumes immense energy, with figures such as $100 million for training ChatGPT-4 highlighting the environmental impact. It is important to balance enterprise AI advancements with sustainability goals, Martin stressed. By leveraging software optimization and cloud-based scaling, Weka aims to make AI deployment more energy-efficient and environmentally responsible.\n“Every time you’re on one of these new generative sites and you’re typing in a prompt to create an image, every time that image gets created, it’s the same power consumed as a full charge of an iPhone,” he said. “It’s maybe no surprise that people are beginning to wake up that while AI may solve the sustainability and environmental challenges on the planet, it’s probably also equally possible that it’s going to be the thing that melts it.”\nThe trajectory of enterprise AI suggests that organizations embracing AI-native frameworks will lead the market in the coming years. In the future, companies will integrate diverse models — both general and specialized — into orchestrated systems to generate actionable insights, Martin envisions. Enterprises that build strong data pipelines and refine their inferencing capabilities will distinguish themselves as industry leaders.\n“I think for the more progressive customers that we’re working with that is the nut that they’re trying to crack. If they can crack that, then I think you’re going to find in just a few years there is going to be two types of companies on the planet,” Martin said. “There’s going to be companies that are AI native at the core that have built a solid data pipeline, and they are industrializing the process of ingesting large volumes of data and transforming that data through an ensemble of models into tokens and into insights.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: WekaIO Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "AMD and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) announced today that the AMD-powered El Capitan has taken the top spot on the semi-annual Top500 list as the fastest-known supercomputer on the planet with 1.742 exaflops of performance. El Capitan debuts on the list at the top spot, catapulting over the previous leader, the 1.3 exaflop Frontier. The Intel-powered Aurora system fell to third place on the list—the system didn't submit a new benchmark run, implying that the partially operational system is still experiencing failure issues on numerous fronts (more below).\n\nThe sheer scale of El Capitan is mind-boggling — the system has 11,136 nodes packed with 44,544 of AMD's MI300A APUs, 5.4 petabytes of main memory, and an exceptionally performant 'Rabbit' near-node storage subsystem (more on those details below). El Capitan achieved 1.742 quintillion operations per second (exaflops) of performance in the benchmark, equivalent to doing one calculation every second for 54 billion years—but El Capitan does that amount of work every second. That's 45% faster than the second-fastest system on the list.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will use the system to modernize the US nuclear arsenal by simulating explosions to eliminate the need for underground detonations and simulate aging effects, safety, and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. The system will also be used to develop two new ICBM designs. The system will be used for HPC and AI workloads, or a fusion of the two.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Top 3 Supercomputers from Top500 System Cores Rmax (PFlop/s) Rpeak (PFlop/s) Power (kW) El Capitan - HPE Cray EX255a, AMD 4th Gen EPYC 24C 1.8GHz, AMD Instinct MI300A, Slingshot-11 11,039,616 1,742 2,746 29,581 Frontier - HPE Cray EX235a, AMD custom 3rd-Gen EPYC 64C 2GHz, AMD Instinct MI250X 8,699,904 1,353 2.055 22,786 Aurora - HPE Cray EX - Xeon CPU Max 9470 52C 2.4GHz, Intel Data Center GPU 9,264,128 1,012 1,980 38,698\n\nEl Capitan boasts a theoretical peak (Rpeak) of 2.746 exaflops of performance. However, that number is calculated with the full performance of all system components operating at peak speeds with perfect linear performance scaling, which simply isn't feasible in the real world.\n\nEl Capitan's Rmax, a real-world performance measurement in the High-Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark that serves as the measuring stick for the top supercomputers, reached 1.742 exaflops in actual use. The Rmax could increase in the future with further system tuning, and the agency says it will do one more full-scale HPL benchmark before El Capitan is moved to a classified network.\n\nIt's also important to note that supercomputer system performance in HPL is measured with full double-precision FP64. In contrast, AI-centric supercomputers are measured with smaller data types that enable much higher 'AI exaflop' ratings, but those aren't directly comparable to the listings on the Top500 list.\n\nEl Capitan consumes >35 megawatts of power at full utilization and delivers 58.89 Gigaflops/watt, taking the 18th spot on the Green500 ranking of the most efficient supercomputers.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

These APUs blend both CPU and GPU cores into the same physical package. Each MI300A chip has 13 chiplets, many of them 3D-stacked, to create a single chip package with twenty-four Zen 4 CPU cores fused with a CDNA 3 graphics engine and eight stacks of HBM3 memory totaling 128GB.\n\nOverall, the MI300A chip weighs in with 146 billion transistors, making it the largest chip AMD has pressed into production. The nine compute dies, a mix of 5nm CPUs and GPUs, are 3D-stacked atop four 6nm base dies that are active interposers that handle memory and I/O traffic, among other functions. You can see the deep dive of the El Capitan topology here. The architecture employs cache-coherent memory to reduce data movement between the CPU and GPU, which often consumes more power than the computation itself, thus reducing latency and improving performance and power efficiency. It also vastly simplifies both porting over older code and creating new code.\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nHPE builds the El Capitan system with its Shasta architecture, which consists of high-density liquid-cooled EX4000 cabinets and EX225a accelerator blades tied together with the Slingshot-11 networking interconnect. This platform powers the DOE's other two exascale supercomputers: Frontier, the previous fastest supercomputer in the world, and the oft-delayed Aurora, which is powered by Intel silicon. That gives HPE the first, second, and third slots on the Top500 list, and all three are the first and only exascale-class systems on the list.\n\nFor comparison, El Capitan is 45% faster than Frontier, the second-fastest super on the Top500 list. The AMD-powered Frontier now occupies the second spot on the Top500 list, giving the company another feather in its hat — AMD's silicon powers the two fastest supercomputers in the world. Interestingly, the Frontier supercomputer also has a new benchmark result for the list with a benchmark of 1.353 exaflops, an increase over the prior submission of 1.194. The Rpeak was also increased from 1.714 exaflops to 2.055 exaflops.\n\nWhile El Capitan is now the fastest known supercomputer in the world, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that China has several of its own exascale-class machines. These are shrouded in secrecy and not submitted to the Top500 list for fear of reprisal via US sanctions.\n\nThe DOE did not submit a new benchmark for Intel's Aurora, which is quite surprising. Six months ago, an Aurora submission cemented the system in the second spot on the Top500, but the system wasn't fully operational. Instead, the benchmark run only comprised 87% of the system active. At the time, Intel said Aurora suffered from numerous hardware issues, including hardware and cooling system failures, operational errors, and network instability. The lack of a new submission implies those errors have not yet been fully rectified. Aurora still leads the AI-centric HPL-MxP mixed-precision benchmark, making it the fastest known AI supercomputer in the world with 10.6 AI Exaflops of performance.\n\nIn fact, AMD powers five of the top ten fastest supercomputers, while Intel has three, Nvidia has one, and Japan's custom-built Arm Fugaku still holds a spot. LLNL also commented that this system is far and away the most cost-effective system deployed at 'even close' to a similar scale, indicating that not only is El Capitan the world's fastest, but it is also the most economical on the cutting edge of technology.",
        "summary": "AMD and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have announced that El Capitan, powered by AMD, is now the fastest supercomputer in the world, achieving 1.742 exaflops of performance and surpassing the previous leader, Frontier. El Capitan is equipped with 44,544 AMD MI300A APUs, 5.4 petabytes of main memory, and a high-performance storage subsystem, and it will be used by the National Nuclear Security Administration for nuclear arsenal modernization and other high-performance computing and AI workloads. The system's theoretical peak performance is 2.746 exaflops, but its real-world performance, measured by the High-Performance Linpack benchmark, is 1.742 exaflops, with potential for future improvement. El Capitan consumes over 35 megawatts of power and ranks 18th on the Green500 list for efficiency, while its architecture, built by HPE, features high-density liquid-cooled cabinets and accelerator blades. Despite its achievements, El Capitan faces competition from other exascale-class machines, including those in China, and Intel's Aurora, which remains the fastest AI supercomputer despite operational challenges.",

While these prices are in no way indicative of the final MSRP, there is a slight upward trajectory—at least for the budget CPUs, but that could boil down to currency conversion and other factors.\n\nThe shared images are rather messy, and you'd need a keen eye to spot and distinguish one SKU from the other. We compiled all information in a chart to draw an accurate comparison against last-generation and current unlocked \"K\" CPU prices. The listed CPUs include the Core Ultra 9 285, Core Ultra 7 265, and Core Ultra 5 225—all in varying configurations in boxed and tray flavors.\n\nThe Core Ultra 9 285 tops the non-K chart at $600, followed by the Core Ultra 7 265, seeping into the $400 territory and landing 5% more expensive than its predecessor. At the bottom of the stack is the slowest Core Ultra 5 225 for $261, which is surprisingly 13% higher than the budget i5-14400. To reiterate, these prices are not and are subject to change, but they give us an idea about the expected pricing structure.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Arrow Lake 65W Listed Price Arrow Lake 125W Unlocked Intel MSRP Raptor Lake Refresh 65W Intel MSRP Core Ultra 9 285 (Boxed/Tray) $600/$573 Core Ultra 9 285K $589 i9-14900 $579 Core Ultra 7 265 (Boxed/Tray) $416/$400 Core Ultra 7 265K $394 i7-14700 $394 Core Ultra 7 265F (Boxed/Tray) $399/$384 Core Ultra 7 265KF $379 i7-14700F $369 Core Ultra 5 245 N/A Core Ultra 5 245K $309 i5-14600 $255 Core Ultra 5 235 N/A — — i5-14500 $242 Core Ultra 5 225 (Boxed) $261 — — i5-14400 $231 Core Ultra 5 225F (Boxed) $244 — — i5-14400F $206\n\nWe should mention that the website is missing several SKUs - including but not limited to the Core Ultra 5 245 and the Core Ultra 5 235. Shipping manifests from Asus indicate that Intel is prepping cheaper H810 and B860 motherboards by Q1 next year.\n\nThese processors will compete against AMD's Ryzen 9000 non-X series, so pricing and socket longevity will play a critical role in influencing the end-user's decision. On that note, Intel has yet to confirm whether it will support future generations on LGA1851. Meanwhile, AMD's AM5 socket is slated to receive support until 2027.\n\nIntel's Core Ultra 200 non-K CPUs are scheduled to arrive at CES 2025 in tandem with other mobile Arrow Lake processors. We don't anticipate significant changes in the retail price compared to the last generation, but that's mere speculation.",

        "content": "This is probably going to make a lot of you feel very old, but by the time Tron: Ares is released next year, 15 years will have passed since Tron: Legacy took us back to the Grid (which itself was a follow-up to the original 1982 classic).\n\nCan this third chapter, from Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales director Joachim Rønning, live up to fan expectations? There's some uncertainty, particularly with Morbius and Suicide Squad star Jared Leto taking on the title role of Ares. However, the fact the Oscar winner is playing a program who leaves the Grid and enters the real world is undeniably intriguing.\n\nTalking to Empire (via SFFGazette.com), Rønning addressed how the move from Daft Punk to Nine Inch Nails on the soundtrack is indicative of the sci-fi franchise's continued evolution.\n\n\"With Nine Inch Nails making the music, this instalment will be a little grittier, a little bit more industrial,\" the filmmaker tells the site. \"It’s been important for me to contrast The Grid and the real world. In that sense, Nine Inch Nails lends itself perfectly into this new Tron world that we are creating.\"\n\n\"What I always look for in any story is a strong emotional core,\" Rønning adds. \"This film will probably be more emotional than people are expecting. It’s about the cost of being human.\"\n\nBack in September, Jeff Bridges reflected on sharing the screen with Leto. \"When Jared played the Joker, I have a friend who played his best friend. He was Mr. J the whole time,\" he explained. \"His name was Ares in the show, and I ended up going, 'Hey Air, what’s happening man?'\"\n\n\"And I say, 'Is it OK if I call you Air?' And he says, 'Yeah, sure you can.' Then we got loose, and it was just wonderful. I mean, we jammed, you know?\" the legendary actor concluded.\n\nThe first official still from Tron: Legacy has also been released. You can take a closer look at that in the X post below.\n\nEXCLUSIVE 🚨#TronAres’ Nine Inch Nails soundtrack is reflective of a ‘grittier, more industrial’ sequel, director Joachim Rønning tells Empire.\n\nREAD MORE: https://t.co/q5DvnfV7Mb pic.twitter.com/cx8eMDFhYo — Empire (@empiremagazine) November 18, 2024\n\nTRON: Ares follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with A.I. beings.\n\nThe movie stars Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Hasan Minhaj, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, and Gillian Anderson. Joachim Rønning directs; producers are Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Leto, Emma Ludbrook and Steven Lisberger.\n\nTRON: Ares arrives in theaters on October 10, 2025.",

        "content": "Mitel brings AI to its multicloud contact experience offering\nCommunications provider Mitel Networks Corp. today is rolling out a new artificial intelligence-powered customer experience platform to help businesses optimize customer interactions by integrating with existing communication tools.\nLaunching in the spring of 2025, Mitel CX is part of the company’s broader effort to modernize its contact center offerings. While most of the industry has pivoted to an as-a-service model, Mitel remains one of the few that delivers its product as an on-premises workload, in a private cloud and as a software-as-a-service offering.\nThe platform is part of Mitel’s Common Communications Framework, which connects various communication tools into a unified system, including phone systems, messaging and video conferencing. Mitel CX enables businesses to tailor their customer experience tools to fit company needs. It includes prebuilt integrations to industry tools and open application programming interfaces. This is especially useful for large companies that have strict rules around data security, compliance and privacy, since they can run the platform on their own servers to maintain control over sensitive information.\nMitel’s current contact center offerings, such as MiVoice MX-ONE, MiVoice Business and OpenScape, include tools for managing outbound interactions and reporting. However, Mitel is now focusing on its existing unified communications customers who may lack a contact center solution or are using competitors’ systems.\n“The main message is that this is Mitel’s next-generation CX platform,” said George Despinic, senior product marketing manager for Mitel’s contact center portfolio. “It’s got all the bells and whistles. You can deploy it how you want, pay for it how you want, and make it work and operate as you wish.”\nTo support contact center agents directly, Mitel CX offers real-time guidance, such as prompts and suggested responses, which resolves issues on the first contact. Customers can engage with agents via omnichannel interactions, spanning voice, video, chat and social media, seamlessly switching among those channels based on their preferences.\nFinally, Mitel CX has features like customizable workflows that allow managers to automate tasks without coding expertise and AI-powered virtual agents to handle routine customer inquiries. Additionally, Mitel CX uses AI to analyze customer calls and interactions data, so managers can make quicker decisions based on real information.\nThough AI is a significant component of the platform, Mitel is cautious not to brand it as “AI-first.” Instead, Mitel is leveraging its expertise in unified communications and contact centers, incorporating AI to increase efficiency, automate routine tasks, and improve how businesses interact with their customers, according to Despinic. For example, Mitel has partnered with Talkative, a U.K.-based firm specializing in AI-driven customer engagement solutions, to incorporate virtual agents, live chat and AI-driven analytics into the Mitel CX offering.\nThe growing focus on AI across industries prompts companies to rethink how they manage their data and deploy technologies. Major vendors such as Nvidia Corp. and VMware Inc. are leading this trend. As AI adoption accelerates, businesses are becoming increasingly concerned with maintaining control over their data — something that’s harder to achieve with fully cloud-based, service-oriented solutions.\nThis shift is pushing companies to reconsider the pure cloud contact-center-as-a-service or CCaaS model in favor of hybrid deployments that blend cloud and on-prem. Companies seek models that offer greater flexibility and data security as AI becomes more integrated into contact centers. The focus on hybrid solutions is gaining traction, particularly as major tech firms stress the importance of data sovereignty and customized AI deployments. Therefore, companies are increasingly favoring solutions that allow them to leverage AI while retaining control over their infrastructure.\nThe ongoing geopolitical issues have spotlighted data and sovereignty issues, particularly in Europe, where Mitel has some straight from its acquisition of Unify, formerly Siemens Enterprise. With an as-a-service model, customers cannot meet in-country compliance mandates, making private cloud and on-premises deployments the preferred model.\n“CCaaS has plateaued,” said Despinic. “Now, the recognition is that there’s still a massive market for hybrid cloud. Our main differentiation is around the hybrid cloud. Mitel CX itself is hybrid because it has the Talkative channels, whereas the rest of the product is installed either on-prem, private cloud, public cloud or single instance. It’s just ingrained in the company’s whole philosophy.”\nMitel is taking a targeted approach for the new platform to expand its presence in the market. In addition to focusing on customers without a contact center solution, Mitel plans to strengthen ties with current partners and attract new ones to broaden its reach. The goal is to establish Mitel CX as the go-to contact center solution for midsized and large companies, with the platform capable of supporting up to 1,200 agents per cluster. In cases where customers need even more capacity, multiple clusters can be deployed to scale up beyond that limit.\nThe company is also expanding its professional services to help businesses with setup, customization and support directly. Rather than relying solely on partners, Mitel will use its team to provide these services, catering to the complex needs of enterprises.\nOn a related note, I’ve been asked whether this affects Mitel’s relationship with Zoom Video Communications Inc. and wanted to clarify it does not. Zoom’s partnership with Mitel is focused on unified communications, where this product launch strengthens Mitel’s contact center portfolio. There is a small bit of overlap, but nothing that should cause friction in the relationship.\nThe CCaaS industry has seen tremendous growth, and I expect that to continue, but it’s not a suitable deployment model for everyone. This is well-timed for Mitel as Avaya LC, the only other provider with a private cloud and on-premises contact center, has chosen to focus on the enterprise segment.\nMitel now uniquely addresses the needs of small and midsized businesses that want on-premises contact centers. Although this might not seem like the most exciting go-to-market, Mitel will be well-positioned as the cloud industry pivots to multicloud.\nZeus Kerravala is a principal analyst at ZK Research, a division of Kerravala Consulting.

        "content": "Dublin, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Strategic Intelligence: The Future of Work\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nThis report provides an overview of the future of work, one of the most important themes impacting the world in which we live. It includes a comprehensive thematic framework for looking at the future of work. This framework comprises five categories: visualization, connectivity, automation, collaboration, and interpretation.\n\nIn 2024, the return to the office has accelerated. Many companies now demand that employees work from the office five days a week. While further return-to-the-office mandates are expected in 2025, many employees will continue to work remotely for at least part of the time. Collaboration tools like video-conferencing and instant messaging are cornerstones of the new hybrid work model. They will also be critical in preventing the emergence of a two-tier workforce, where remote workers are at a disadvantage compared to their office-based colleagues.\n\n\n\nKey Highlights\n\nAccording to the International Labor Organization (ILO), despite a decrease in unemployment compared to pre-pandemic levels, labor underutilization remains a major concern, with large employment deficits remaining. These are particularly pronounced in developing countries and among women. Talent shortage will likely drive technology investment and adoption, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI). Automation will reshape offices and factories and change the nature of work. This will require training existing and new staff to ensure they have the necessary skills.\n\nAI is currently the hottest enterprise tech trend, thanks to generative AI's emergence and growing ubiquity. Generative AI tools can generate responses to inquiries, draft prose, and glean patterns and themes from data. While AI has been around for a while, it is only recently, with the rise of generative AI, that governments worldwide have become more concerned about the impact of AI applications on societies. As generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in workplaces, corporations must ensure that their AI systems align with ethical and regulatory standards.\n\nReasons to Buy\n\nThe future of work will reshape both factories and offices, encouraging greater collaboration between humans and technology and empowering workers with new digital skills. In the background, technology is bringing about profound political, economic, and social change, especially visible in changing demographics and the issues it raises, the debate around greater automation, and how themes like artificial intelligence (AI) could change the way we work. This report helps you make sense of this vitally important theme, by providing you with a clear thematic framework.\n\nIn addition, we identify those companies that are developing and adopting the most advanced technologies across the future of work framework. These companies are the most likely to emerge as winners in this theme.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nPlayers\n\nThe analyst's Future of Work Framework\n\nTrends\n\nMarket Size and Growth Forecasts\n\nTimeline\n\nSignals\n\nCompanies\n\nGlossary\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThematic Research Methodology\n\nCompanies Featured\n\n3D Systems (DDD)\n\n8X8\n\nABB\n\nAdobe\n\nAeye\n\nAlibaba\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlsera\n\nAlteryx\n\nAmazon\n\nAmbarella\n\nAnthropic\n\nAppian\n\nApple\n\nAT&T\n\nAutodesk\n\nAutomation Anywhere\n\nBaidu\n\nBlue Frog Robotics\n\nBosch\n\nCambricon\n\nChina Broadcasting Network\n\nCisco (Webex)\n\nClarifai\n\nCloud Software Group (TIBCO)\n\nCloudera\n\nCogView\n\nDassault Systemes\n\nDataRobot\n\nDJI\n\nEhang\n\nEpic Games\n\nEricsson\n\nEverysight\n\nFANUC\n\nFormlabs\n\nFujitsu\n\nGE Additive\n\nGM (Cruise)\n\nHitachi\n\nHP\n\nHuawei\n\nHubsan\n\nHubSpot\n\nHyundai (Boston Dynamics)\n\nIBM\n\niFlytek\n\nInflection AI\n\nIntel\n\nKawasaki\n\nMagic Leap\n\nMarkforged\n\nMegvii (Face++)\n\nMichelin (RoadBotics)\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMidea (KUKA)\n\nMidjourney\n\nMonday CRM\n\nNeurala\n\nNICE\n\nNokia\n\nNvidia\n\nOmron\n\nOpenAI\n\nOracle\n\nParrot\n\nPerplexity.ai\n\nPipedrive\n\nProtoLabs\n\nPython\n\nQlik\n\nQualcomm\n\nRakuten Mobile\n\nRealWear\n\nRingCentral\n\nRokid\n\nSalesforce\n\nSamsung Electronics\n\nSAP\n\nSchneider Electric\n\nSeiko Epson\n\nServiceNow\n\nSony\n\nSpatial\n\nStability.ai\n\nTeradyne\n\nTesla\n\nThirdEye\n\nTrimble\n\nUiPath\n\nUltiMaker\n\nUVify\n\nVarjo\n\nVerizon\n\nXiaomi\n\nXreal\n\nYuneec\n\nZendesk\n\nZoho\n\nZoom\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/xpkjgk\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

        "content": "How Dell’s AI Factory and strategic partnerships are shaping enterprise AI\nThe rapid evolution of artificial intelligence is reshaping the enterprise landscape. As organizations face growing pressure to adopt scalable AI solutions, Dell AI Factory offers an integrated approach intended to meet these demands, as announced at this week’s SC24 event.\nThis new era poses challenges for businesses, which must balance budget constraints alongside demands to innovate. As theCUBE has written about extensively, enterprises seek a deeper AI value.\n“Enterprises are fighting a dual mandate of operating inside a tight information technology budget envelope while at the same time transforming their organization into an AI-first company,” wrote theCUBE Research co-founder and Chief Analyst Dave Vellante in a recent edition of his Breaking Analysis series. “Navigating macroeconomic headwinds while driving innovation is an exciting challenge for IT decision-makers.”\nThose challenges have led many organizations to actively search for solutions that simplify AI integration while supporting broader business objects. Included in the mix is Dell Technologies Inc. and Dell AI Factory, which is intended to meet the growing demand for integrated AI solutions by offering what the company says is access to the industry’s broadest AI portfolio. In today’s era, data centers have to be designed from the ground up to handle AI’s speed and scale while new AI PCs are transforming productivity and collaboration, according to Jeff Clark, vice chairman and chief operating officer of Dell.\n“What’s needed are new IT infrastructure and devices purpose-built to meet the specific demands of AI. The Dell AI Factory helps customers accelerate AI adoption with the world’s broadest AI portfolio and leading AI ecosystem partners, offering right-sized approaches and greater control over AI deployments on-premises, at the edge and across cloud environments,” Clark recently said.\nDell says its AI Factory initiative aims to equip enterprises with the capabilities to integrate AI across their operations and drive digital transformation. Given the rapidly evolving nature of enterprise AI, it’s worth examining what’s on offer from the company and what might come next.\nThis feature is part of SiliconANGLE Media’s exploration of Dell’s efforts in enterprise AI. Be sure to watch theCUBE’s analyst-led coverage of SC24 from November 19-21. (* Disclosure below.)\nDell AI Factory intended to be end-to-end AI solution\nIn breaking news from today’s SC24 event, Dell announced that it expanded AI Factory with new high-powered servers and dense racks. The updates include the PowerEdge XE9685L and XE7740 servers, designed for high-density AI and HPC workloads, with support for advanced Nvidia and Intel processors and GPUs. Dell is also enhancing its AI Factory, Data Lakehouse and professional services to streamline AI adoption and improve performance for enterprise applications. Check out the breaking news on siliconangle.com.\nGoing back to earlier this year, Dell announced it was expanding its infrastructure portfolio with new Nvidia Corp.-powered AI platforms. At the time, Dell said its AI Factory was intended to be an “end-to-end AI enterprise solution” for training, tuning and running AI models, combining Nvidia chips with products from Dell’s compute, storage, client device and software portfolios, as well as professional services.\nThose services, the company said, were intended to ease tasks, such as preparing AI datasets. In April, more detail was provided by Scott Bils, vice president of gen AI professional services at Dell. Dell AI Factory is intended to be an end-to-end solution for enterprises, providing them with an “easy button” for AI. It brings the breadth of Dell infrastructure and hardware: “Compute, storage, networking, workstations … plus Nvidia AI infrastructure and their software stacks, including the new MIM microservices software that they’ll be bringing to market,” Bils said during an interview with theCUBE.\nIt also involves a combination of Dell and Nvidia professional services. That’s intended to provide a turnkey solution, he added: “To help them address their biggest challenges, their most complex issues around adopting AI use cases, and driving those into operations and production.”\nThe solution combines Dell’s compute, storage and security capabilities with Nvidia’s AI infrastructure, intended to offer businesses a comprehensive, end-to-end system to accelerate business transformation and boost productivity. The fully-integrated solution is intended to take advantage of rack-level design, while utilizing rigorous testing and validation to transform data into valuable insights and outcomes, according to the company.\n“This solution also leverages existing offerings in enterprise data security with accompanying Dell services offerings in security and privacy,” the company said in a recent release. “The Dell AI Factory with Nvidia supports a wide array of AI use cases and applications to support the entire gen AI lifecycle, from model creation and tuning to augmentation and inferencing.”\nCustomers can also take advantage of enterprise-grade professional services, the company said. It also stated that Dell AI Factory is available via traditional channels and Dell APEX.\nData and partnerships\nThe Dell AI Factory also intends to draw on the “raw material” of customer data. Despite that, the company notes that the success of any AI initiative depends on the quality of the data used.\n“The Dell AI Factory brings AI as close as possible to where data resides to minimize latency, lower costs and maintain data security by keeping sensitive information within a controlled environment,” the company wrote in a recent blog. “It also provides a way to prepare this data for use by the AI factory, ensuring that customers are working with quality and accurate data, with easy access and built-in data governance.”\nThe Dell AI Factory promises to simplify AI adoption with an all-in-one infrastructure package, aiming to deliver on the complex needs of modern enterprises. With that in mind, the company has sought to highlight its partnership with Nvidia, which it claims can simplify development, automate workflows and deliver up to 86% faster business outcomes.\n“Dell Technologies and Nvidia have a long-standing partnership with over 25 years of joint innovation, focused on accelerating innovation and delivering cutting-edge platforms, solutions and software that enable transformative results for our joint customers,” the company wrote of the partnership in May.\nIt also outlined another partnership deal aimed at AI development in recent months. A deal with Hugging Face Inc. is intended to set up a development hub on Hugging Face’s development platform, with an eye towards enabling organizations to train and deploy open customized large language models on-prem on Dell infrastructure.\n“Dell will be Hugging Face’s preferred on-prem infrastructure provider to support enterprise adoption of tailored open-source gen AI data sets, libraries and models,” said Varun Chhabra, senior vice president of product marketing for Dell’s infrastructure solutions group, in May.\nAn eye toward redefining enterprise AI\nWith an eye toward redefining enterprise AI, Dell has positioned its AI Factory as an all-in-one solution to help enterprises overcome the complexities of AI adoption. The company says its partnerships with Nvidia and Hugging Face can help it get there.\nAs CEO Michael Dell explained at Dell Technology World 2024, the goal is to bring AI to the data and leverage factories to convert data to intelligence for a business. Its strategy is clear, according to Bob Laliberte, principal analyst at theCUBE Research.\n“To accelerate the building of these AI factories, Dell and its partner ecosystem will provide all the infrastructure and services required to build these on-premises environments. This includes high-performance servers, GPUs, networking, storage, and even AI-enabled PCs,” Laliberte wrote in May.\nIn this new era, organizations must embark on AI initiatives to remain competitive, but the barrier to entry is high, as most companies need more skills and knowledge of where to start, according to Laliberte. Dell is looking to change that with its end-to-end solutions and in helping to focus organizations on outcomes that they desire.\n“Dell customers even have access to a free AI accelerator workshop to help them get started. The most crucial step is the first: Organizations must dedicate the time and resources to understand how AI can help their business,” Laliberte said. “Dell wants to help accelerate the time to create your own AI Factory, leveraging its own and ecosystem partner solutions.”\nIt’s clear that Dell’s AI Factory reflects a company goal to make AI adoption achievable for enterprises. With such a priority reflected across the enterprise, this week’s SC24 announcements are showing how Dell’s solution is driving impactful results.\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for SC24.

Neither will it let me change desktop scaling.ThanksStuart\n\nWow, that is a genuine surprise to me. No desktop scaling with HD4000?? I would think that would be a good troubleshooting step, if it worked. Do you have the option to buy a cheap GPU? There are basic workstation GPUs for $200ish that would work fine.Matrox used to make a great workstation AGP device but Im not sure if they continued to make GPUs, but they do still have some of the most pristine 2d desktop workstation rendering on the planet. Do a quick search for Matrox on newegg or somewhere. (if you would even consider a new card)",

But that’s a name that AOOSTAR and other PC makers already used last year for a very different computer: a DIY network-attached-storage (NAS) system with a cylindrical design and two bays for 3.5 inch hard drives.\n\nAnyway, the new 3.5 inch mini PC has an M.2 2242 slot under the hood for a PCIe NVMe or SATA SSD, a fan and copper heat sink for cooling, and a set of ports that includes:\n\n3 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A (10 Gbps)\n\n1 x USB Type-C (with DisplayPort Alt Mode)\n\n1 x DisplayPort\n\n1 x HDMI\n\n2 x 2.5 Gb Ethernet\n\n1 x 3.5mm audio\n\n1 x DC power input\n\nThere’s also support for “dual band WiFi” and Bluetooth, but the product description is a little vague on which version of those wireless standards are supported.\n\nIF this mini PC looks familiar, that’s because it’s similar to a set of 3.5 inch mini PCs that were released in the past few years, including last year’s AOOSTAR T-Box. But the T-Box is a little smaller (at 87 x 87 x 40mm) and features two Gigabit Ethernet ports and three HDMI ports. So the new model should support faster wired network connections and while both support up to three displays, the new model uses a different set of ports to accomplish that.\n\nvia ITHome and @realVictor_M\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

        "content": "WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump is now receiving intelligence briefings ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration, the Washington Post and NBC News reported Tuesday, citing unnamed U.S. officials.\n\nA spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment specifically on whether Trump was being briefed. “ODNI is acting consistent with the tradition, in place since 1952, of providing intelligence briefings to the President-elect,” the office said in a statement.\n\nTrump’s transition team did not respond to requests for comment. But if past precedent applies, Trump’s briefings began soon after he was re-elected to a second term by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris on Nov. 5.\n\nMore:Is Trump signaling retribution agenda with Gaetz, other picks for his administration?\n\nA rocky relationship with America's spies\n\nTrump has a long history of clashing with intelligence agencies dating to before his first term.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIn 2016, the FBI and Justice Department launched investigations into Russian interference in that year's presidential race that touched on many members of his campaign. Later, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials concluded that Russia had used disinformation on social media and other tactics to help Trump's campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community assessed in recent months that Russia was even more aggressively meddling in the 2024 election to help Trump, smear Harris and undermine faith in the electoral process. Federal officials said those efforts did not affect the outcome of the race.\n\nWhile Trump remains under federal indictment over his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden the case has been put on hold, and likely will be dropped, given Justice Department policy that bars prosecution of a sitting President.\n\nA separate case against Trump, for hoarding top-secret documents taken from the White House at the end of his first term, was dismissed by the trial judge in June. An appeal by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith will likely be dropped.\n\nBriefings on a world of threats\n\nThe intelligence community provides classified briefings to the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees to ensure a smooth transition once one of them takes office.\n\nTrump declined to receive classified briefings during the just-concluded campaign, citing his contentious relationship with the CIA and other agencies.\n\nIn an August interview with the Daily Mail, Trump claimed the \"Deep State\" would blame him for leaks if any classified information he received was later made public.\n\nHe added, “I don't want them, because, number one, I know what's happening. It's very easy to see what's happening.”\n\nAs for the briefings, he said, “I’ll have plenty of them when I get in.”\n\nNow that he's back in, Trump’s picks for top intelligence jobs have roiled many current and former spies and analysts, who say he plans to take a wrecking ball to the nation’s intelligence community.\n\nLast week, Trump designated John Ratcliffe, his former Director of National Intelligence, as the next CIA director.\n\nThe former Republican House member from Texas was a strong defender of Trump's while in Congress, where he served on the House Judiciary, Intelligence and Homeland Security committees.\n\nBut Ratcliffe drew criticism for allegedly using his ODNI post to serve Trump's political interests during his first term, including by selectively declassifying information about the Russian interference probe that began in the Obama administration.\n\nTrump also tapped former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as his next Director of National Intelligence. Critics have complained that Gabbard – who became a Republican this year – has parroted Russian talking points, including criticizing the U.S. for opposing President Vladimir Putin’s war efforts in Ukraine and Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, the top independent watchdogs for the CIA and ODNI said they are leaving their roles following Trump’s election, according to the non-profit Project On Government Oversight (POGO).\n\nFederal inspectors general are appointed by the president.",

        "content": "FIRST ON FOX: South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham sent a letter to each of the 51 former intelligence officials who signed a memo suggesting Hunter Biden's laptop had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation.\n\n\"In your letter, you claimed that the laptop story was ‘Russia trying to influence how Americans vote,’\" Graham’s letter to former CIA directors Leon Panetta and Michael Hayden, former Director of National Intelligence [DNI] James Clapper and 48 others said.\n\n\"I ask you to respond publicly to one simple question: if you knew then what you know now about the laptop, would you still have signed the October 19, 2020 letter?\"\n\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR SAYS TRUMP SHOULD NOT PARDON HUNTER BIDEN\n\nGraham, a Republican, has previously suggested yanking the security clearances of officials who signed the letter.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance pledged during the campaign that the incoming Trump administration would strip the clearances of all 51 signatories.\n\nOver the summer, Fox News Digital asked all 51 officials whether they regretted signing on to the now-debunked letter.\n\n\"No,\" Obama-era DNI James Clapper responded.\n\nMark Zaid, an attorney representing seven of the signatories, said it was \"patriotic\" for his clients to sign on to the letter.\n\n\"There continues to be by many a calculated or woefully ignorant interpretation of the October 2020 letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials concerning Hunter Biden's laptop,\" Zaid said.\n\nGreg Treverton, a signatory who previously served as chair of the National Intelligence Council, defended the letter in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\nBIDEN COMMITTED ‘IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT,’ DEFRAUDED UNITED STATES TO ENRICH HIS FAMILY': HOUSE GOP REPORT\n\n\"This is very old news,\" Treverton said. \"What we said was true. We were inferring from our experience, and it did look like a Russian operation. We didn't, and couldn't, of course, say it was a Russian operation. Enough said.\"\n\nThe now-infamous letter said their national security experience had made them \"deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.\"\n\n\"If we are right,\" they added, \"this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.\"\n\nDespite claims from former officials that the laptop had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation, Fox News Digital reported that federal investigators with the Department of Justice knew in December 2019 that Hunter Biden’s laptop was \"not manipulated in any way\" and contained \"reliable evidence.\" But they were \"obstructed\" from seeing all available information, according to an IRS whistleblower involved in the probe nearly a year before the former intelligence officials and President Joe Biden declared it was part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe laptop was introduced into evidence in a Delaware courtroom last week by prosecutor Derek Hines and handed to FBI agent Erika Jensen, who had earlier explained how the FBI authenticated the laptop and extracted data. In Hunter Biden's gun trial, she testified about dozens of text messages, metadata, photos and short videos found on phones and iCloud accounts belonging to Hunter Biden.",
        "summary": "South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham sent a letter to 51 former intelligence officials who had signed a memo suggesting Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation, asking if they would still sign it knowing what they know now. Graham has suggested revoking the security clearances of these officials, and Vice President-elect JD Vance has pledged to do so under the incoming Trump administration. Despite the laptop being authenticated by federal investigators, some signatories, like James Clapper, do not regret signing the letter, and attorney Mark Zaid defended their actions as patriotic. Greg Treverton, another signatory, maintained that their suspicions were based on their national security experience, which led them to believe it resembled a Russian operation. The Department of Justice had known since December 2019 that the laptop was not manipulated and contained reliable evidence, but investigators were reportedly obstructed from accessing all information.",

        "content": "Apple has released an emergency patch to fix two vulnerabilities that hackers have exploited to target Intel-based Mac computers.\n\nThe previously unknown \"zero-day\" flaws led Apple to issue patches for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Details are thin, but both bugs involve a Mac, iPhone, or iPad processing \"maliciously crafted web content\" to trigger the operating system to execute rogue computer code.\n\n\"Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems,\" the company said for both vulnerabilities.\n\nOne of the flaws, CVE-2024-44309, can cause a cross-site scripting attack through Apple’s WebKit browser engine, which is used in Safari and web browsers for iOS and iPadOS. The resulting attack can inject malicious computer code into a legitimate website or app.\n\nMeanwhile, the second vulnerability, CVE-2024-44308, can trigger Apple’s JavaScriptCore software to run malicious computer code without the user’s permission. Apple's advisory suggests hackers used both flaws together to target older Intel-based Macs, which the company started transitioning away from in 2020 in favor of using its own Arm-based M chips.\n\nApple learned about the vulnerability from Google security researchers Clément Lecigne and Benoît Sevens. Both work for the company’s Threat Analysis Group, which focuses on countering government-backed hacking. Hence, there’s a good chance a state-sponsored hacker or commercial spyware vendor used the vulnerabilities to target specific users.\n\nIn response, Apple released patches with macOS Sequoia 15.1.1, iOS 18.1.1, and iPadOS 18.1.1. Those on iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 or who own the Apple Vision Pro headset can also receive the fix. To install the patch on an iPhone, go to Settings > General > Software Update. The device can also patch itself automatically if you’ve switched on automatic updates. Mac users can patch by going to the Apple icon > System Settings > General > Software Update.",

        "content": "Apple has released an emergency patch to fix two vulnerabilities that hackers have exploited to target Intel-based Mac computers.\n\nThe previously unknown \"zero-day\" flaws led Apple to issue patches for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Details are thin, but both bugs involve a Mac, iPhone, or iPad processing \"maliciously crafted web content\" to trigger the operating system to execute rogue computer code.\n\n\"Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems,\" the company said for both vulnerabilities.\n\nOne of the flaws, CVE-2024-44309, can cause a cross-site scripting attack through Apple’s WebKit browser engine, which is used in Safari and web browsers for iOS and iPadOS. The resulting attack can inject malicious computer code into a legitimate website or app.\n\nMeanwhile, the second vulnerability, CVE-2024-44308, can trigger Apple’s JavaScriptCore software to run malicious computer code without the user’s permission. Apple's advisory suggests hackers used both flaws together to target older Intel-based Macs, which the company started transitioning away from in 2020 in favor of using its own Arm-based M chips.\n\nApple learned about the vulnerability from Google security researchers Clément Lecigne and Benoît Sevens. Both work for the company’s Threat Analysis Group, which focuses on countering government-backed hacking. Hence, there’s a good chance a state-sponsored hacker or commercial spyware vendor used the vulnerabilities to target specific users.\n\nIn response, Apple released patches with macOS Sequoia 15.1.1, iOS 18.1.1, and iPadOS 18.1.1. Those on iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 or who own the Apple Vision Pro headset can also receive the fix. To install the patch on an iPhone, go to Settings > General > Software Update. The device can also patch itself automatically if you’ve switched on automatic updates. Mac users can patch by going to the Apple icon > System Settings > General > Software Update.",

Although the content was rather around Panther Lake iGPUs, it still confirmed the existence of the Xe3 architecture.\n\nIntel panther lake celestial\n\nPTL_U_A0 gfx ver == 30 (gfx3000)\n\nA0 step pic.twitter.com/CUsFImXkwi — Tomasz Gawroński (@GawroskiT) November 17, 2024\n\nNot just this, but apparently, an Intel engineer on LinkedIn (via @Haze2K1) has disclosed himself as the \"Lead Project Architect\" for Xe3 and Xe3p GPU IPs as well, hinting that Celestial is very much alive and thriving but under the wraps for now.\n\nAnother bit of information to support Intel's \"Celestial\" dGPU existence is the fact that we saw preliminary support of Xe3 \"discrete\" GPUs drop by in HWINFO a few months ago, which yet again refutes the fact that Battlemage will be the last dGPU release.\n\nAnother important aspect here is that Intel is indeed betting on the future of its dGPU business upon how its upcoming Battlemage lineup performs in terms of consumer adoption, given that with Intel switching to TSMC for the first time with its desktop GPUs, coming on par with competitors.\n\nSadly, we have little to no leaks about what to expect with Intel's \"Celestial\" desktop GPUs, given that enablement work isn't existent for now, although this is likely to change once Battlemage drops by in the markets. Despite all the lows, Intel has still managed to be consistent with its GPU business, whether iGPUs or dGPUs, showing the firm's commitment to promoting the PCMR and a competitive environment.",

Information from leakers and data miners, such as Bionic_Squash and Tomasz Gawroński, confirms the existence of the Xe3 architecture, which is also linked to Intel's next-gen mobile SoCs. An Intel engineer has identified himself as the \"Lead Project Architect\" for Xe3, further supporting the ongoing development of Celestial GPUs.

        "content": "Scalable AI: Open-hardware solutions driving the next wave of AI innovation\nSilicon diversity is redefining the future of artificial intelligence by addressing critical challenges in performance, cost and scalability.\nAs AI workloads grow increasingly complex, spanning inference, training and multimodal applications, the need for adaptable, open hardware solutions is at an all-time high. This shift prioritizes flexibility and efficiency, allowing enterprises to choose the best tools for their specific needs while driving innovation and resource optimization across industries, according to Steen Graham (pictured, left), chief executive officer of Metrum AI Inc., which is partnering with Dell Technologies Inc. on AI workload innovation.\n“I think right now with AI, we’ve really kind of optimized software in a great way,” Graham said. “We’re building this really systematic software with AI workers that will save people material, time and ultimately drive top-line revenue and getting enterprises to really high-fidelity solutions.”\nGraham and Manya Rastogi (right), technical marketing engineer at Dell Technologies, spoke with theCUBE Research’s John Furrier and Savannah Peterson at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed how Metrum and Dell work together, as well as how silicon diversity is transforming AI infrastructure by enabling flexible, cost-effective and scalable hardware solutions to meet evolving enterprise demands. (* Disclosure below.)\nOptimizing AI workloads through silicon diversity\nThe benefits of emerging hardware, such as the Dell PowerEdge XE9680 Rack Server with Intel’s Gaudi 3 AI Accelerator, have placed silicon diversity in AI infrastructure into the limelight. Designed to provide enterprises with unparalleled flexibility, this system supports open-compute modules and integrates networking features to eliminate the need for additional hardware, reducing costs while increasing scalability, according to Rastogi.\n“There are a few challenges which exist in the industry today,” she said. “What Gaudi 3 with Intel kind of solves is you don’t have any more like one GPU, you have choices. Second thing, it’s basically an OAM, which is open compute accelerator module, like the cart, the GPU cart. It ultimately builds up to a big board … which are in the XE9680 server. It’s a way out of the proprietary networking and software … all this networking also provides you an opportunity for scale out … in a cost-efficient data center that you can get out of it.”\nCentral to this innovation is addressing the industry’s demand for choice. By offering alternatives to proprietary GPUs, the PowerEdge XE9680 empowers organizations to avoid hardware lock-in and tailor solutions to their specific workloads, Graham said.\n“The one thing about enterprises today, before they deploy AI, they really want to know what the fidelity of it is,” he elaborated. “Both from all the performance metrics we love like throughput and latency, but the quality of the AI. We actually announced our new ‘Know your AI’ platform where we test the AI in development and in production for those domain specific quality metrics, as well as those typical metrics we all love at Supercompute, like latency and throughput.”\nMetrum AI is collaborating with Dell Technologies to address key AI and machine learning workloads that drive innovation in real-world applications. Together, they are focusing on critical areas such as inferencing, fine-tuning and distributed fine-tuning to optimize performance across diverse workloads.\n“It’s just part of the messaging for Dell with silicon diversity,” Rastogi said. “We want all our customers to have every single choice that they can have with the XE9680 servers. And that’s where this comes in.”\nKey use cases include AI agents for customer service, fine-tuning large language models and distributed processing for industries such as healthcare, manufacturing and telecommunications. Dell showcased the platform’s potential through live demonstrations, such as autonomous AI agents capable of performing complex tasks such as generating service tickets and upselling plans.\n“They want to pre-program AI agents to get things done and then they want to loop humans in the loop later for quality assessments as well,” Graham said. “Humans don’t need to be in the loop for every token every second. I think what we’re all hoping for AI to do some work for us, that we don’t have to sit there with it and … co-pilot all the time.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: Dell Technologies Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

That means software can be written without the need for centralized corporations or middlemen. Morpheus seeks to provide interfaces to run open-source large language models as part of a decentralized cloud to allow developers to take advantage of this new model.\nIn a whitepaper written about the project, Morpheus calls itself a “Linux-type alternative for developers.” It allows developers to spin up LLMs quickly at no cost and allows users to maintain control over their own business and personal data. That helps avoid data leaks, hacks and potential losses of sensitive information to competitors that can happen when using centralized models controlled by other services.\nMorpheus is Web3-native, meaning that people can use their access to AI models to connect cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure directly. As a result, developers can use their LLM to buy and sell crypto tokens and stablecoins and interact with decentralized finance. That’s something that only specialized AI systems built for particular blockchains can currently do.\nThe platform was developed using the codebase for Lumerin, a protocol that runs on the Arbitrium blockchain. Arbitrium is one of the largest Ethereum layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions that includes smart contract capabilities.\n“The world’s most powerful AI systems are being controlled by a handful of companies,” said Ryan Condron, Lumerin’s co-founder and project leader. “At Lumerin, we’re on a mission to decentralize AI compute, breaking down these walls to make AI accessible and equitable. Morpheus represents a future where everyone has control over their data and privacy, free from censorship or corporate interference.”\nMorpheus initially launched a public testnet in July. This is an experimental preview for developers to prepare and test applications before launching its main service. Today’s announcement brings its mainnet online, which is where LLM compute and storage will be deployed.\nAs a blockchain-based project, Morpheus provides an incentive for developers and users — crypto token rewards called MOR. Builders working on applications for end users, including smart agents, front ends, decentralized apps and tools can receive MOR as rewards. The network can also be strengthened by users supplying compute power through running nodes to process user queries and be rewarded with MOR based on demand and performance.\nImage: Shutterstock/Production Perig\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Inspectors general for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) are heading for the exit before the new Trump administration takes power, the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) reported Monday.\n\nThe departure of the agency watchdogs represents some of the first officials to remove themselves from the administrative state before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has vowed rid the federal bureaucracy of rogue and corrupt actors.\n\nWATCH — So Long, AG Disgrace! Merrick Garland Waves Goodbye After Tumultuous Tenure:\n\nTo carry out those reforms, Trump nominated John Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence from 2020 to 2021, to lead the CIA. He also nominated Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat congresswoman from Hawaii, to be Director of National Intelligence.\n\nPOGO reported on the departures of ODNI Inspector General Thomas Monheim and his counterpart at the CIA, Robin Ashton:\n\nOne of the departing inspectors general, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s Thomas Monheim, first took his watchdog role after Trump fired his predecessor Michael Atkinson in the spring of 2020. Atkinson had transmitted a whistleblower complaint to Congress that sparked Trump’s first impeachment in 2019. … Monheim and his counterpart at the CIA, Robin Ashton, were both nominated by Biden and confirmed by the Senate in 2021 (Monheim began serving as acting inspector general the year before, during the first Trump administration). … Appointed by the president and housed within executive agencies, inspectors general investigate waste, fraud, and abuse of power and are responsible for reporting wrongdoing both to agency directors and to Congress. Oversight by inspectors general has long been considered to be more important when both the executive branch and Congress are under control of the same political party.\n\nThe term “administrative state” specifically describes the phenomenon of unaccountable and unelected administrative agencies, including the national security apparatus, exercising power to create and enforce their own rules. The administrative state uses its rule-making ability to essentially usurp the separation of powers between the three branches of government by creating a so-called fourth branch of government not formed by the Constitution.\n\nWATCH — Here We Go… Democrat Calls for Creation of “Shadow Cabinet” to Block Trump Administration:\n\nMany unelected bureaucrats within the administrative state also use their position to inflict their own agenda on citizens. For instance, before the “laptop from hell” story broke in 2020, 51 intel officials signed a letter that insinuated Hunter’s laptop was Russian disinformation. Politico peddled the letter under the title “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.” The 51 signatories, however, seemingly knew the Politico story was false at the time because the FBI had the laptop that Hunter abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop. President Joe Biden cited the story during a 2020 presidential debate with Trump to discredit the laptop’s contents. The story was reportedly planted by Secretary of State Antony Blinken for Biden to use during the event.\n\nWendell Husebo is a political reporter with Breitbart News and a former RNC War Room Analyst.

        "content": "Scalable AI infrastructure reshaping data centers: theCUBE insights from SC24\nThe boundaries of high-performance computing are being redefined by artificial intelligence, driving innovations that prioritize scalable AI infrastructure to meet growing demands for efficiency and power.\nAs enterprises adopt advanced AI-ready systems, the tech industry is moving beyond theoretical applications to deliver tangible solutions. This transformation is reshaping data center capabilities, promoting sustainability and fostering collaboration across academia, government and private sectors to address global challenges, according to John Furrier (pictured, left), executive analyst at theCUBE Research.\n“I think this year you’re starting to see real build-out around the infrastructure hardware and where hardware is turning into systems,” he said. “You’re going to start to see the game change and then the era’s here, the chapter’s closed, the old IT is over, and the new systems are coming in.”\nFurrier spoke with fellow theCUBE Research analysts Savannah Peterson (center) and Dave Vellante (right) at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed how AI and scalable AI infrastructure are transforming high-performance computing, sustainability and enterprise solutions. (* Disclosure below.)\nAI infrastructure driving innovation through democratization and scalability\nAt this week’s Supercomputing 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia, theCUBE’s industry analysts discussed the shift from traditional HPC to systems tailored for AI-driven workloads. Once confined to niche applications, HPC is becoming accessible to enterprises of all sizes, thanks to innovations from companies such as Nvidia Corp. and collaborations across sectors, according to Furrier.\n“This year the conversation is supercomputing is democratized thanks to Nvidia’s messaging and all their work,” he said. “But now the computers on premise, the data center technologies have to be rebuilt and then connected to the cloud for customization. I think this year will be the year, the era of clustered systems, on-premise edge where it’s just the system that’s going to matter.”\nThe industry has seen a surge in interest from builders who are tasked with creating cutting-edge systems. These builders bridge the gap between hyperscalers, such as Amazon Web Services Inc., and traditional hardware giants, such as Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., Furrier explained.\n“There’s a new level of builder emerging. It’s the classic hyperscalers on the high end,” he said. “Then you’ve got the enterprise, like the Dells, the HPEs. They’re going to embed their devices and systems, obviously servers. They control the IT. The Broadcoms and the chip guys are targeting these new builders, because they’re going to come into the enterprise and build it.”\nCentral to this evolution is Nvidia’s continued leadership in AI infrastructure hardware. The company’s H100 GPUs and the introduction of Blackwell chips have set new benchmarks in performance, though not without challenges. Reports of “melting racks” have reignited discussions on sustainable cooling technologies, according to Peterson.\n“We’re at that inflection … when are we going to make AI real, when are we going to start realizing some of this high-performance computing gains in terms of the world, not just in terms of prototypes?” she asked. “We’ve got this this type of a conversation going on that means innovation is moving at light speed or a super-hot speed. As someone who’s been a hardware nerd their whole life, I feel like hardware is having its moment.”\nSustainability and quantum computing: Key trends shaping HPC\nSustainability is emerging as a pivotal concern in HPC. The intersection of energy efficiency, cooling advancements and dense chip design underscores the need for long-term solutions. From direct liquid cooling to on-chip innovations, these developments are enabling more efficient systems while addressing environmental concerns.\n“There’s a whole challenge of how do you cool these things, liquid cooling is now back in a big way,” Vellante said. “We’ve got a panel this afternoon on direct liquid cooling, and we have one of the foremost experts in the field coming on to talk about phase change, and there’s a big debate about whether or not that can scale.”\nQuantum computing also garnered attention, with experts suggesting its hybrid integration with classical computing architectures as the next major leap. While widespread adoption may still be 24-36 months away, its potential to revolutionize encryption and scientific modeling cannot be overlooked, Furrier explained.\n“Quantum’s definitely going to happen, that’s not going to dominate this year because it’s still out there,” he said. “IBM and others see it coming fast because the first order of businesses [is] get the clustered systems up and running because you got to power the software … I think the innovations in the data center is going to be this year’s theme, quantum’s right around the corner, the app frameworks is going to be key.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for SC24.

        "content": "IBM advances AI efficiency with intelligent storage innovations\nThe role of AI storage solutions is more critical than ever in today’s evolving artificial intelligence landscape.\nWith enterprises navigating increasingly complex datasets and energy-intensive workloads, innovations in storage technology are essential to support high-performance computing and AI, according to Sam Werner (pictured), vice president of product management at IBM Corp. The transformative potential of intelligent storage systems is reshaping how organizations optimize AI workloads and enhance overall performance.\n“You have to be able to store all this data very efficiently,” Werner said. “You’ve got to have low power and cooling costs because you have to make way for all the very power-hungry graphics processing units required to do AI and supercomputing. First of all, you have to have very efficient storage. It has to be super fast because you don’t want these GPUs sitting idle. They’re very expensive.”\nWerner spoke with theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante and John Furrier at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed innovative storage solutions, their impact on AI workloads and the future of scalable, efficient data management. (* Disclosure below.)\nAI storage solutions for the modern era\nIBM is evolving AI storage solutions with innovations such as Content-Aware Storage, which integrates intelligence directly into the system to optimize performance and reduce inefficiencies, according to Werner. This approach allows enterprises to perform real-time data optimization without duplicating datasets across systems, offering a significant advantage for scaling AI and high-performance workloads.\n“We’re changing this paradigm completely,” Werner said. “Rather than bringing all your data and building this vector database, what if we did all of that in the storage, put accelerators in the storage products and actually did the vectorization as data changes? We know when the data changes here, right? So, we can actually vectorize it in real time.”\nActive File Management, another key feature of IBM Storage Scale, simplifies data access across diverse storage systems, Werner noted. By providing a unified global namespace, enterprises can manage unstructured data without copying everything into a single storage pool, streamlining operations and improving accessibility.\n“Rather than saying copy everything into one uber storage pool … we have something in Scale called Active File Management,” he said. “Scale has a global namespace. We give you one single namespace you can use everywhere and scale forever. Then, we can talk to all of your unstructured data sources using our Active File Management and cache the data in.”\nAs organizations face rising operational costs and sustainability challenges, energy efficiency is also a significant focus for IBM. With its AI storage solutions, including the IBM Storage Scale System 6000, IBM delivers high performance while consuming considerably less energy than competing systems, according to Werner.\n“I challenge anybody watching this to go and look at the kilowatts required to run our Scale System 6000 versus the competitors,” he said. “Look at how much capacity you need to support … Nvidia published SuperPod specs or BasePOD specs. Look at our energy consumption versus the competition. We’re at least half, and, in a lot of cases, depending on which competitor, even more than that. That’s huge.”\nAs AI workloads grow, IBM continues to prioritize ease of use and automation. Realizing that skill shortages challenge many organizations, IBM works to integrate AI capabilities into its systems to simplify management and improve efficiency, Werner explained.\n“We want to make it so it’s not just about supporting AI; it’s putting AI down into our products,” he said. “Automatic recovery, automatically diagnosing problems, telling you what issues need to be addressed without you having to have such a huge number of skills to support it.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for SC24.

        "content": "Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.\n\nBut the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.\n\nThat's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.\n\n“These companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,” said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “The broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.”\n\nIt takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining — the “P” in ChatGPT — that involves AI systems “learning” from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.\n\nHowever, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work — such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.\n\nGPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\n\n“With training, you’re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that’s a lighter weight,” said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.\n\nThat's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals — such as AMD and Intel — to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.\n\nD-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 — a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.\n\n“There were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was ‘you’re too late,’” he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.\n\nNow, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.\n\n“We spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That’s training, right?” he said. “And then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge — and then you get rewarded for being efficient.”\n\nThe product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips — and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.\n\nThe chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months — if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.\n\nD-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.\n\nWhile tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.\n\nForrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.\n\n“The dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,” Nguyen said. “Buying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there’s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.”\n\nFeldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.\n\nHe said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.\n\nBetter-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.\n\nSheth says the big concern right now is, “are we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI — human-like intelligence?”\n\nIt’s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence — predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.\n\n“But then what about the rest?” he said. “They cannot be put on the same path.”\n\nThe other set of companies don’t want to use very large AI models — it’s too costly and uses too much energy.\n\n“I don’t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don’t think they appreciate that. It’s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,” Sheth said.",
        "summary": "The development of AI chatbots has heavily relied on Nvidia's specialized GPUs, which are efficient for training AI models but less so for inference tasks. This inefficiency in inference has opened opportunities for other companies, like Cerebras and d-Matrix, to develop AI inference chips that are more cost-effective and energy-efficient for running AI applications. D-Matrix, for instance, is launching its Corsair product, designed to handle AI inference tasks more efficiently, targeting a broader market beyond tech giants. The demand for AI inference chips is expected to grow as more companies seek to integrate AI technologies without building extensive AI infrastructures. The focus on inference chips also addresses concerns about the environmental impact and energy consumption associated with large AI models, highlighting the potential for more sustainable AI development.",

        "content": "Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.\n\nBut the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.\n\nThat's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.\n\n“These companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,” said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “The broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.”\n\nIt takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining — the “P” in ChatGPT — that involves AI systems “learning” from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.\n\nHowever, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work — such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.\n\nGPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\n\n“With training, you’re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that’s a lighter weight,” said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.\n\nThat's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals — such as AMD and Intel — to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.\n\nD-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 — a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.\n\n“There were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was ‘you’re too late,’” he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.\n\nNow, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.\n\n“We spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That’s training, right?” he said. “And then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge — and then you get rewarded for being efficient.”\n\nThe product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips — and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.\n\nThe chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months — if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.\n\nD-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.\n\nWhile tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.\n\nForrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.\n\n“The dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,” Nguyen said. “Buying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there’s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.”\n\nFeldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.\n\nHe said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.\n\nBetter-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.\n\nSheth says the big concern right now is, “are we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI — human-like intelligence?”\n\nIt’s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence — predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.\n\n“But then what about the rest?” he said. “They cannot be put on the same path.”\n\nThe other set of companies don’t want to use very large AI models — it’s too costly and uses too much energy.\n\n“I don’t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don’t think they appreciate that. It’s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,” Sheth said.",
        "summary": "The development of AI chatbots has heavily relied on Nvidia's specialized GPUs, which are efficient for training AI models but less so for inference tasks. This inefficiency in inference has opened opportunities for other companies, like Cerebras and d-Matrix, to develop AI inference chips that are more cost-effective and energy-efficient for running AI applications. D-Matrix, for instance, is launching its Corsair product, designed to handle AI inference tasks more efficiently, targeting a broader market beyond tech giants. The demand for AI inference chips is expected to grow as more companies seek to integrate AI technologies without building extensive AI infrastructures. The focus on inference chips also addresses concerns about the environmental impact and energy consumption associated with large AI models, highlighting the potential for more sustainable AI development.",

The departure of the agency watchdogs represents some of the first officials to remove themselves from the administrative state before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has vowed rid the federal bureaucracy of rogue and corrupt actors. To carry out those reforms, Trump nominated John Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence from 2020 to 2021, to lead the CIA. He also nominated Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat congresswoman from Hawaii, to be Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\n\n(Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...\n\nTOPICS:\n\nFront Page News\n\nGovernment\n\nNews/Current Events\n\nPolitics/Elections\n\nYour Opinion/Questions\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\ncia\n\ndni\n\nericholder\n\nholder\n\nig\n\nigs\n\nintel\n\nmonheim\n\nnbp\n\nnbpcase\n\nodni\n\npogo\n\nresign\n\nrobinashton\n\nthomasmonheim\n\ntop\n\ntrump\n\ntulsigabbard\n\nwatchdogs\n\n\n\nClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.\n\nMore winning\n\n\n\nTo: ChicagoConservative27\n\nThey shouldn’t get any pension if wrong doing and corruption is discovered.\n\n\n\nTo: ChicagoConservative27\n\nBarry’s weaponized “seventeen intelligence communities” are melting down.\n\n\n\nby 3 posted onby FlingWingFlyer (Let's Go Brandon!

        "content": "Update to Apple's latest iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS to patch known security vulnerabilities that may have been exploited on Intel-based Macs.\n\nThe iOS 18.1.1, iPadOS 18.1.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1.1, and visionOS 2.1.1 updates fix two major security issues in the software that runs websites and apps. Hackers could use these flaws to take control of your device or steal information through malicious web content.\n\nApple has also confirmed that these vulnerabilities \"may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.\"\n\nIntel-based Macs are vulnerable in this case because their architecture handles certain software frameworks, like WebKit and JavaScriptCore, differently compared to devices running Apple Silicon. These frameworks are important for web browsing and executing JavaScript code, but their interaction with Intel processors may create specific weak points under some circumstances.\n\nApple also released iOS 17.7.2 and iPadOS 17.7.2 to address the issues on older devices that cannot update to the latest operating systems.\n\nOne of the vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-44308 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database is tied to JavaScriptCore. JavaScriptCore is a framework used for running JavaScript code in apps and websites.\n\nThe flaw could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a device if a user interacts with maliciously crafted web content. Apple addressed the issue by introducing stronger checks in its software to better detect and prevent malicious activities. These checks ensure that any data or code running on the system is thoroughly validated before being processed.\n\nThe second vulnerability, CVE-2024-44309, involves WebKit, the engine that powers Safari and other web-based functions on Apple devices. The issue could enable attackers to carry out cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by exploiting flaws in how cookies are managed.\n\nApple fixed the issue by improving \"state management,\" or how its software manages and tracks certain data, like cookies, during web browsing and app interactions. The improvements make sure that hackers can't exploit flaws in the system to gain unauthorized access or perform harmful actions.\n\nBoth security flaws were discovered and reported by security researchers Clement Lecigne and Benoit Sevens.\n\nHow to protect your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro\n\nTo keep your device secure, start by opening the Settings app on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro or System Settings on Mac. From there, go to the \"General\" section and select \"Software Update\" to check for the latest version available. Once the update appears, tap \"Download and Install\" to begin the process.\n\n15-inch MacBook Air\n\nBefore starting, make sure your device is connected to a stable Wi-Fi network to avoid interruptions during the download. Additionally, ensure your device has enough battery life, or keep it plugged into a charger to prevent it from shutting down mid-update.\n\nThe iOS 18.1.1 and iPadOS 18.1.1 updates are available for a range of Apple devices. On the iPhone side, the update supports models starting from the iPhone XS and newer.\n\nFor iPads, the update is compatible with several models, including the iPad Pro 13-inch and 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), and the iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later). Other supported devices include the iPad Air (3rd generation and later), the 7th generation iPad and newer, and the iPad mini 5th generation and later.",

        "content": "OpenText broadly enhances customer experience cloud suite\nOpenText Corp., the maker of a diversified set of cloud-based information technology and knowledge management products, today unveiled a set of enhancements and new products around the theme of artificial intelligence enablement.\nThey’re combined in version 24.4 of Cloud Editions, a platform that combines information management, cloud-based applications, security and AI. Collectively, the new features are intended to modernize content management, improve security and speed developer productivity.\nHighlights of the new release of OpenText Experience Cloud, which combines media, communications, messaging and data around customer experience, include expanded messaging channels, often for managing customer preferences and simplified communications management. Users of Experience Cloud can send personalized promotions at scale with integrated email and short messaging campaigns.\n“A company like Pacific Gas & Electric, which uses our products, can communicate to the millions of customers in California in 10 minutes,” said Chief Product Officer Muhi Majzoub. Generative artificial intelligence can automatically create letters explaining a service outage, for example, revise the document based on feedback and paste it into a templated email to send to a mailing list, he said.\nMessaging at scale\nOrganizations can now use the Rich Communication Services messaging protocol and Meta Platforms Inc.’s WhatsApp to deliver richer media and branded messages. New cloud fax features combine security certifications, easier use and a portfolio of integrations with multifunction printers and electronic health record systems\nNew options for managing customer data and preferences in OpenText Communications and OpenText Web CMS allow businesses to make customer journeys more personalized using unified profiles and real-time data. New migration tools also help organizations transition to cloud-native customer communication management applications more easily.\nIn the area of enterprise content management, OpenText is announcing the general availability of a digital asset management application it announced last spring. The software is already in use at Walt Disney Co., Target Corp. and L’Oreal SA, Majzoub said.\nintegration with Guidewire Software Inc.’s property and casualty insurance software. The company’s ECM software already integrates with SAP SE, Microsoft Corp.’s Teams and office productivity software, Google LLC’s Workspace, Oracle Corp.’s E-Business Applications, ServiceNow Inc. and Salesforce Inc. “All the images and video they show you comes from our digital asset management solution,” he said.\nA new Core Cloud Network Observability toolset is intended to give IT teams greater visibility across multicloud, on-premises and edge networks. It integrates with OpenText’s Application Observability and Network Operations Management to create a more comprehensive view of cloud infrastructure interactions with on-premises systems to help IT teams identify and resolve performance issues more efficiently.\nSmarter BI\nOpenText Intelligence Aviator harnesses generative AI to make business intelligence data more accessible. Powered by large language models, it allows users to interact with BI data conversationally, without the need for specialized query language skills. The software also automatically suggests analyses and visualizations based on user queries.\nNew archiving and content security features intended to better manage legacy data and mitigate risks include Information Archive 24.4 integration with Content Aviator to enable organizations to archive generative AI data securely with advanced search capabilities that work against archives of any size. That keeps enterprise data safe but still available for large language model training, the company said. It also accelerates early case assessment and legal scenarios by reducing the time needed for the discovery process.\nOpenText’s extended detection and response products “have the ability to tap into log files from many security tools that enterprises and governments use,” said Majzoub. “They generate billions of rows of log files every month. Our automated XDR has the ability to interact with these different tools and present you a summary of the threat with the recommendation of what the action you should take.”\nAlso in the security realm, Thrust API for Content Intelligence is a set of application program interfaces designed to identify and control sensitive content such as personal data, proprietary information and offensive materials. Thrust APIs are typically designed to accelerate specific operations or functionalities. In this case, they automate content risk management and ensure compliance with security and regulatory guidelines.\nFor developers, OpenText DevOps Aviator is getting new features focused on enhancing software development workflows. AI-Assisted User Stories generates relevant user stories to accelerate development efforts and improve prioritization. Video-to-Defect Translation converts hours of testing video footage into actionable test steps within minutes to increase testing accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI integration provides developers with tools to streamline workflows while safeguarding proprietary data.\nPhoto: OpenText/Flickr CC\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) MSRP $4,560.00 Score Details “If you’re on a quest for power, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) lies at the end of the journey.” Pros Excellent overall and graphics performance\n\nBright, vivid display\n\nEye-catching design\n\nComfortable, customizable keyboard\n\nGreat webcam\n\nHealthy offering of ports Cons Prohibitively expensive\n\nWeak speakers\n\nI love an obnoxious laptop, and the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 16-inch laptop is most certainly obnoxious and proud of it. From its dappled forged carbon fiber lid, to its overclockable Intel Core i9 HX processor and Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU, this is a laptop that isn’t afraid to throw its weight around. And why should it be? With specs that powerful, you can game, create content, and plow through any work that might fall into your lap. Hell, you might find Jimmy Hoffa with this thing (OK, I’m being facetious with that last one, but the Legion 9i is a serious powerhouse).\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHowever, a pair of subpar speakers mar an otherwise great laptop. And we can’t forget the price, which will prevent all but the most deep-pocketed gamers from partaking in the awesomeness. But if you want an absolute force of one of the best gaming laptops available, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) is a must-see.\n\nSpecs and configurations\n\nLenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 Dimensions 14.1 x 10.93 x 0.75 ~.89 inches Weight 5.51 pounds Processor Intel Core i9-14900HX Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090/Intel UHD Graphics RAM Up to 64GB LPDDR5 5600MHz Display 16-inch 3,200 x 2000 mini-LED Storage Up to 2TB (RAID 0 1TB+1TB) PCIe SSD (Gen 4) Touch No Ports 2x Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A, 1x, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type C, 1x HDMI 2.1 Wireless Killer WiFi 6E* 802.11AX (2 x 2) and Bluetooth 5.1 Webcam 1080p + IR camera Operating system Windows 11 Pro Battery 99 watt-hour Price $3,840\n\nLenovo only offers one pre-built configuration of the Legion 9i Gen 9 on the company site, and the $4,560 price will definitely make more than a few wallets wince.\n\nThe configuration I reviewed has a 2.2-GHz Intel Core i9-14900HX Meteor Lake Refresh processor with 32GB of 5600Mhz DDR5 RAM, two 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSDs in RAID 0 configuration, integrated Intel UHD Graphics, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU with 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 16-inch, 3200 x 2000 mini-LED, 16:10 aspect ratio display with a 165Hz refresh rate and 3-millisecond response time and Windows 11 Home. However, you can save yourself almost $1,000 if you purchase the system from B&H which currently has the laptop on sale for $3,399.\n\nThe base model of the Gen 9 can be found in the configure menu on Lenovo’s website. It costs $3,840 and halves the storage and drops the GPU to a 4080 GPU with 12GB of video memory. If you want to max out the specs, prepare to fork out $4,665, which will add Windows 11 Pro and 64GB of RAM to the mix.\n\nA unique, elegant design\n\nThe Legion 9i doesn’t look like any other gaming laptop on the market. It doesn’t even look like any laptop in its line. That’s because Lenovo used forged carbon fiber for its lid that with the company’s eight-layer stamping method, the lid is 10% lighter and stronger than regular aluminum. In terms of looks, the lid falls somewhere in between one of those old-school composition notebooks and some elegant camouflage. And while that process makes for a lighter, tougher lid, the slightly textured panel is a one-of-one with each notebook sporting a different pattern. As nice as the lid looks, you’ll want to have a microfiber cloth handy as the lid is highly susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.\n\nThere’s a small silver metal Lenovo plate embedded into the lower-left corner of the lid with a large RGB-backlit Legion emblem running vertically down the right. The camera and mic housing sits top center with its glossy metal covering protruding ever so slightly, The hinge connecting the lid and bottom of the laptop is large and extends into a rather large vent that has several ports. A thin RGB light strip creates a line of delineation between the hinge and vent.\n\nThe notebook’s interior and undercarriage are made primarily of recycled magnesium colored carbon black. Compared to other gaming laptops, the palm rest is rather small, but there’s still enough room to accommodate most wrists and a small metal Lenovo tag in the lower-right corner. The trackpad is long instead of tall and sits below the island-style keyboard as it glows seductively. Above that is a large air vent with the power button sitting front and center. The 16-inch display is ensconced in matte black bezels with a small lip at the top making the lid easier to open.\n\nThe Legion 9i’s undercarriage is almost all vent with two raised rubber feet to assist with airflow. The back foot has a middle divot stamped with Legion, which is a nice touch. You have a pair of bottom-firing speakers toward the front and two large vents along the sides. The bottom panel is held in place with six screws in case you want to access the laptop’s interior.\n\nThe notebook has a solid array of ports and slots befitting a laptop of this size. You have a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port on the right with a physical camera disable switch. On the left sits an SD card reader and a headset jack. You’ll find the rest of the ports in the rear with another USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a HMDI 2.1 port, Ethernet port, and a proprietary DC-in jack.\n\nCompared to its competitors, the 5.51-pound, 0.75 ~0.89 inch x 14.1 x 10.93-inch Legion 9i is almost a lightweight. The Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 (0.91 x 11.57 x 15.71 inches) is the big man on campus here at 6.83 pounds, but keep in mind that this is an 18-inch laptop. Next up, is the Alienware m16 R2 (0.93 x 14.33 x 9.81 inches), which weighs 5.75 pounds. And finally, we have the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 (13.94 x 9.69 x 0.64 inches) that tips the scales at 4.1 pounds, which is the lightest of the bunch.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nIn the battle between matte and glossy displays, Lenovo has chosen matte for the Legion 9i. And while matte panels effectively cut down on glare and reflections, they’ve been known to deliver muted color. I found the 16-inch, 3200 x 2000 mini-LED panel delivered great color and detail, which took some of the hurt from the many deaths I suffered while playing Black Myth: Wukong. Speaking of which, thanks to the inclusion of Nvidia’s G-Sync software and the panel’s 165Hz refresh rate and 3ms response rate, my attacks, dodges, and parries were as smooth as butter, as were my myriad of deaths.\n\nThe display achieved 100% of the sRGB color gamut. However, on the Adobe sRGB and DCI-P3 gamuts, the screen reached 88 and 99%, respectively. Both results are short of the 100% Lenovo claims. But in case the panel isn’t as vivid as you’d like, the laptop has Dolby Vision software to adjust the color temperature. My light meter clocked the display’s brightness at 692 nits, which is impressive for a matte panel.\n\nI knew when I took my initial tour around the laptop, I identified one of its few flaws: the bottom-mounted speaker. And sure enough, once I started streaming tracks on Spotify, the pair of 2W Harmon speakers produced mediocre audio. The volume couldn’t fill my medium-sized living room. Even worse, the low end is hollow more often than not with weak bass and percussion no matter the genre. And this is despite having Nahmic’s audio software preinstalled, which is one of the better apps out there.\n\nBut the audio quality deteriorates when using the laptop on your lap. My thighs swallowed up the tiny speaker grilles, which in turn, muffled the audio. You’re definitely going to need a pair of headphones or a gaming headset if you have any expectation of good audio.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nLenovo’s smile-shaped keys bring a smile to my face. While they’re not as good as what you’d find on the company’s ThinkPad line of laptops, the Legion 9i’s keyboard with its Chiclet-style keys with their 1.5mm key travel are super comfy to type on with firm feedback and no bottoming out. The keycaps are large with generous spacing. And while I rarely use the NumPad, I’m always glad to see it included. I surpassed my usual 70-words-per-minute average on the MonkeyType typing test, hitting 85 wpm.\n\nThe keyboard features per-key backlighting, which allows you to create a custom light show with every key glowing in a different shade via the Lenovo Vantage app. This is also where you can set macros, monitor system health, adjust camera and display settings, and much more.\n\nThe Legion 9i’s touchpad is smaller than what I’m used to nowadays, but it got the job done. Multitouch gestures such as pinch-zoom, two-finger scroll and three-finger tap performed seamlessly. The trackpad offers good palm rejection with strong feedback on the bottom corners.\n\nWebcam and connectivity\n\nThe Legion 9i has one of the best integrated webcams I’ve seen this year on a gaming laptop. The color on the 1080p shooter is great, capturing the exact shade of bubblegum pink of my wrapped locs. Details were so sharp, you can see almost every wrinkle in my sunflower yellow shirt. It’ll definitely hold up in a video call or a live stream.\n\nAnd in some other webcam fun, the laptop has Tobii’s eye-tracking software preinstalled in the form of Tobii Aware and Horizon. The former dims the screen when you’re not looking at it while the latter lets you control a game using head-tracking.\n\nAs for connectivity, the Legion 9i has a Killer WiFi 6E* 802.11AX (2 x 2) network card with Bluetooth 5.1.\n\nCPU performance\n\nWho ordered a ridiculous amount of power, because the Legion 9i has a double serving. The notebook sports a 24-core Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market. The juggernaut came out swinging on the Cinebench R24 multi-core test, beating all competitors.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Lenovo only edged out its predecessor by a few points. And as usual, the MacBook Pro 16 with its M3 Max chipset beat out all challengers. The M4 Max would surely push this comparison even further, though we’ve only tested the M4 Pro model so far. The single-core portion of the Cinebench R24 had a similar outcome with the Legion 9i leading the gaming laptops, and the MacBook being the overall winner. The Legion 9i managed to score a definitive victory over everyone during the GPU portion of Cinebench R24, including the MacBook.\n\nWe got similar results on both the multi- and single-thread runs of Geekbench 6 test, with the Legion surpassing its gaming laptop rivals. It’s interesting to see how close last year’s Legion 9i is to its descendent. But as powerful as the new kid on the block is, it couldn’t overtake the MacBook 16 with its highly optimized chipset and operating system. Although the Legion is primarily a gaming laptop, it is more than capable of handling any video, photo, or audio editing project you have up your sleeve. Running the PugetBench tests for both Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, the Lenovo maintained a slight lead over everything but the MacBook Pro.\n\nGaming\n\nWhile it’s nice that the Legion can handle all your productivity and content creation tasks, you’re here to game. And with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the Legion 9i is more than ready for those marathon gaming sessions. That’s not to say there wasn’t some competition. While the Legion 9i achieved high marks on the 3DMark Time Spy test, it wasn’t enough to topple the ROG Strix Scar 18. The Legion however, is only a few points shy from matching the Scar. The Legion 9i got the upper hand on the 3D FireStrike test.\n\n1600p resolution has become the sweet spot for many gamers, but at its 2000p native resolution, the Legion 9i frame rate never dropped below 90 frames per second, even on titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong, and Forza Horizon 5, which are some of the most graphically taxing games on the market.\n\nThanks to the GPU and its 16GB of video memory, you can crank up all the settings to the max and that includes ray tracing. And if you want to squeeze every frame out of the system, feel free to enable Nvidia’s DLSS technology. My only other gripe with the Legion 9i is the fans. The laptop’s trio of fans are seriously loud with Performance mode enabled. It’s to be expected with a laptop of this caliber as is the heat exhaust blowing from the top of the keyboard deck.\n\nBattery life\n\nGaming laptops this stacked are a series of checks and balances. Sure, you’ll get ridiculous power, but man, is that battery life going to suck. However, the Legion 9i lasted longer than expected with a time of four hours, nine minutes on the video playback test with the power setting on Best Performance at 100 nits of brightness. That’s a little longer than the Scar 18, but it falls short of the Alienware m16 R2 and the ROG Zephyrus G16.\n\nStill, that time is respectable for a gaming laptop, especially one with these heavy duty specs. Thanks to Nvidia’s Advanced Optimus software, which is essentially a MUX switch, the laptop can switch over to its integrated Intel UHD Graphics chip, when handling less graphically taxing tasks. That way, the laptop can last longer on a charge.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIf you’re on a quest for power, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) lies at the end of the journey. The desktop replacement is a certified beast, sporting a one-two punch of an Intel Core i9 processor and an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU. Whether it’s gaming, creating content, or productivity, the Lenovo Legion 9i can handle it all with unflappable aplomb. On top of that, it’s got a lovely display, comfortable, customizable keyboard, a crispy webcam, and it’s got an interesting design.\n\nThe only real flaw the notebook has is its weak speakers and of course, the exorbitant price, which is a shame as the Legion 9i is just a stone’s throw from perfect. Offering some more customization in terms of configurations may have allowed a more affordable entry point too. Sure the fans can get loud, but that’s to be expected in a gaming laptop.\n\nIf you want something with longer battery life, consider the Alienware m16 R2 or the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16. But for people that want power, plain and simple. It’s a bit of a niche laptop at this price, but you’d be hard pressed to find something better than the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch).",

        "content": "Nvidia posts another strong earnings beat as customers race to deploy next-gen Blackwell GPUs\nArtificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia Corp. delivered a better-than-expected earnings and revenue beat as it posted its hotly anticipated third quarter financial results.\nIt also offered guidance for the coming quarter that was higher than expectations, yet its stock fell almost 2% in extended trading.\nThe company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 81 cents per share, beating Wall Street’s projection of 75 cents. Revenue for the period rose 94% year-over-year, to $35.08 billion, ahead of the $33.16 billion analyst target.\nThe numbers show Nvidia is continuing to grow rapidly on rampant enterprise demand for its AI processors, though investors will have noted that its revenue growth slowed in comparison to the previous three quarters, when sales rose by 122%, 262% and 265%.\nEven so, the profits kept pouring into the company. Net income rose to $19.3 billion in the quarter, up from just $9.24 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia said it’s expecting to see revenue of around $37.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, just above the analysts’ consensus estimate of $37.08 billion. That forecast implies year-over-year revenue growth of about 70% from the previous year, slowing from annual growth of 265% in the year-ago quarter.\nAI drives demand\nNvidia’s rampant sales have been driven by incredible demand from cloud infrastructure providers and other enterprises for its iconic graphics processing units, which power the vast majority of AI workloads today. The company has been the single largest beneficiary of the technology industry’s race to embrace AI, and it has emerged to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company.\nMost of the growth stems from Nvidia’s data center business, which covers sales from AI chips and related components and makes up the lion’s share of its revenue. The company attributed $30.8 billion of its sales to that segment, up 112% from a year earlier, beating the Street’s forecast of $28.82 billion.\nNot all of those sales were GPUs, though. The company said around $3.1 billion of revenue attributed to the business comes from the sale of networking components such as its InfiniBand products.\n“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” said Nvidia founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang (pictured).\nNvidia also reported a gross margin of 73.5%, just above the Street’s estimates, which was attributed to the sale of increasing numbers of data center chips.\nThird Bridge analyst Lucas Keh said Nvidia’s data center unit delivered sequential growth of 17% during the quarter, and he expects the company to be able to maintain that rate for some time to come. “Our experts believe this growth rate could continue throughout 2025 as cloud providers increase their appetite for data center GPUs,” he said.\nElsewhere in Nvidia’ business, sales of GPUs for gaming delivered $3.28 billion in revenue, beating the Street’s forecast of $3.03 billion. According to the company, this was the result of increased demand for high-powered GPUs in personal computers and laptops, plus rising console-related revenue.\nThe much smaller automotive and professional visualization businesses also posted strong results. Sales in the former rose 72%, to $449 million, while in the latter, they increased 17%, to $486 million.\nFirst Blackwell chips shipped\nAnalysts were also looking for Nvidia’s guidance for its next-generation Blackwell GPUs, which promise to deliver a 30-times performance boost versus the existing H100 chips while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% on some workloads. The company had initially planned to ship the Blackwell chips in the second half of this year, but its plans came unstuck when a design flaw was revealed, causing the launch date to be pushed back to early 2025.\nEarlier this week, reports emerged that claimed Blackwell might be subject to further delays from supposed overheating problems when testing clusters of multiple chips linked together in data center server racks, though the company played down such fears.\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Collette Kress shrugged off the report in a conference call with analysts, saying the company intends to expand production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter and accelerate production through fiscal 2026.\nShe added that most customers, including the likes of Microsoft Corp., OpenAI and Oracle Corp., have already started receiving samples of the Blackwell GPUs, with 13,000 shipped out so far. “Every customer is racing to be the first to market,” Kress said. “Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.\nKeh said it was interesting to note that the concentration of revenue attributed to public cloud providers increased on a sequential basis during the quarter. “This points to positive signs of hyperscale adoption for Blackwell, despite the delays,” he explained.\nAccording to Kress, Blackwell shipments are expected to ramp up significantly in the next year, and she thinks the company is on track to generate “several billion dollars” of revenue in the fourth quarter. She added that sales of the current-generation H200 chip also increased substantially in the quarter. The company recently announced the launch of a new and improved version of the H200 GPUs, called the H200 NVL, which provides a 1.5-times memory efficiency increase and 1.2-times bandwidth increase over the H100 NVL.\n“Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026,” Kress added.\nKeh said there are indications that Nvidia’s pricing strategy for Blackwell won’t be as aggressive as analysts had previously thought. He said the sequential decline in data center GPU margins was because customers are shifting from older H100 systems to more complex systems such as the H200 and the Blackwell-based B200 chips.\n“If the transition to these GPUs is negatively impacting Nvidia’s margins, this confirms Blackwell pricing will not be as aggressive initially, likely to spur adoption against competitive threats like AMD,” he pointed out.\nPhoto: Robert Hof/SiliconANGLE\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",
        "summary": "Nvidia reported strong third-quarter earnings, surpassing Wall Street expectations with earnings of 81 cents per share and revenue of $35.08 billion, driven by high demand for its AI processors. Despite the impressive results, Nvidia's stock fell nearly 2% in extended trading, possibly due to a slowdown in revenue growth compared to previous quarters. The company's data center business, which includes AI chips, contributed significantly to its revenue, with sales reaching $30.8 billion, a 112% increase from the previous year. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell GPUs, expected to deliver substantial performance improvements, have faced delays but are now being shipped to major customers, with production expected to ramp up significantly.

        "content": "Intel has never talked about Jaguar Shores before, and it will probably bring together both Gaudi ASICs and Xe-HPC GPUs.\n\nIntel Jaguar Shores is a next-gen AI GPU, aimed at faster AI inference and will probably utilize the in-house 18A node\n\nIntel may not look in a good position right now, but it is continuing its plans for the client and server platforms. The company has been working on the next-gen Intel Battlemage GPUs, which has been leaked recently, but Battlemage isn't the only GPU it is planning to launch shortly.\n\nAs per the report from HPC Wire, the company has revealed its plans for next-gen AI chips. The company usually brings high-performance chips on the Intel Gaudi platform from Intel's Habana Labs division and while Gaudi 3 will be shipping in volume next year, the latest addition to its lineup won't be just limited to Gaudi. Intel revealed that it is working on a new high-performance chip for powerful computing, known by the code name \"Jaguar Shores\".\n\nThis was revealed at the SC2024 conference where Intel shared its roadmap comprising its high-performance chips for AI workloads. The Jaguar Shores is the successor to the Falcon Shores, the latter being planned for a 2025 release. Similar to Falcon Shores, the Jaguar Shores is likely to be a GPU rather than a processor for the Intel Gaudi Accelerator.\n\nFalcon Shores was initially designed to be a hybrid GPU-CPU solution, but now it is going to be a dedicated GPU for AI inference. The Jaguar Shores is said to be in a similar situation but might bring a GPU-ASIC design for delivering enhanced AI Inferencing. With Intel keeping its eye on the next-gen 18A manufacturing node, Intel will likely go with in-house 18A for both Falcon Shores and Jaguar Shores to leverage the power of technologies like RibbonFET and backside power delivery for improved efficiency.\n\nOur AI investments will complement and leverage our x86 franchise – with a focus on enterprise, cost-efficient inferencing. Our roadmap for Falcon Shores remains, - Intel Spokesperson\n\nIntel already outsources some of its chips from TSMC like Lunar and Arrow Lake, but this time it wants to have an advantage with the 18A, which will also be used in Clearwater Forest next year. A few years later, Intel also plans to utilize the in-house 14A process node in 2027.\n\nIntel Jaguar Shores will go against giants like NVIDIA and AMD, which already have a consistent roadmap of high-performance GPUs through 2027. Both companies dominate the AI training and inference markets, which is why Intel is targeting mostly the inference market with the upcoming chips.\n\nWe continuously evaluate our roadmap to ensure it aligns with the evolving needs of our customers. While we don’t have any new updates to share, we are committed to providing superior enterprise AI solutions across our CPU and accelerator/GPU portfolio. - Intel Spokesperson\n\nIntel has been struggling with its roadmap, which led to the cancellation of the Rialto Bridge GPU last year. The lack of foresight can be seen with the Falcon Shores as well, which transitioned from CPU+GPU to only discrete GPU. Furthermore, Intel also canceled the Ponte Vecchio GPU after the supercomputer Aurora went online.\n\nIntel has to carefully strategize and execute its plans amid the leadership turmoil, which saw frequent changes in the GPU leadership and organization in general. It has already slowed down drastically in the client CPU market, and it can't afford to lag in the AI market as well.\n\nNews Source: HPCWire",

        "content": "Throughout this very long war, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has continued to operate even though there has been a constant threat of missile strikes and drone attacks. But now it has closed because it has received “specific information” that the Russians are about to conduct a “significant air attack”. By the time many of you read this article, that attack may have already happened. We don’t know exactly when the Russians will strike, and we don’t know what specific targets they will hit, but it appears that they are gearing up for something really big.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ukrainians fired 6 long-range missiles provided by the United States into Russia.\n\nThen on Wednesday, the Ukrainians fired 12 long-range Storm Shadow missiles provided by the United Kingdom into Russia…\n\nUkraine has launched several Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Russia’s Kursk region, the Express understands. Images posted to Telegram purport to show fragments of the British-French-made missiles after explosions were reported in the village of Marine, Kursk, on Wednesday.\n\nThe Russians aren’t just going to sit there and absorb these strikes.\n\nEveryone knew that a response would be coming, and now it appears that response is imminent.\n\nJust a little while ago, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv explained that it has closed due to specific intel that it has received…\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received specific information of a potential significant air attack on November 20. Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place. The U.S. Embassy recommends U.S. citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.\n\nThere are reports that the Russians are preparing to use Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers to strike Ukraine. There are also reports that indicate that RS-26 long-range missiles may also be used.\n\nThese are very serious weapons.\n\nWhen Joe Biden allowed the Ukrainians to use long-range missiles to strike Russia, we crossed a very important red line.\n\nIn fact, one of the reasons why this entire war started in the first place was because the Russians were determined to keep western missiles out of Ukraine.\n\nJust imagine how we would feel if Russian missiles were being staged just south of the border in Mexico and they were being used to hit U.S. cities.\n\nWe should not underestimate the anger of the Russian people at this moment.\n\nOn Russian television, pundits are openly talking about how nuclear war with the western world appears to be inevitable, but our leaders just keep assuring us that everything is fine. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin insisted that the Russians are bluffing and that there is no threat of nuclear war…\n\nAustin insisted on NBC Tuesday night that Russian President Vladimir Putin was bluffing about the use of nuclear weapons despite the fact he approved of a new nuclear weapons doctrine that justifies a nuclear response to any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by a non-nuclear country backed by a nuclear power. “We’ve known for several weeks that they were revamping their policy on use of nuclear weapons. As I look at, you know, what they’re doing, and I — I — we watch their strategic forces, you know, very carefully, I don’t see a change in their strategic force posture,” Austin said. “We’ll continue to remain vigilant in this regard. But at this point, no, I — I don’t see an indication that there’s an imminent intent to — to use nuclear weapons.”\n\nI don’t think that there is an “imminent intent” to use nuclear weapons either, but if we keep pushing the Russians into a corner eventually they will feel like they have no choice.\n\nThe Russians would very much like to avoid a nuclear conflict, but over time the warnings that they have been issuing have been taken “less and less seriously” by leaders in the western world…\n\nPutin, who began issuing nuclear threats shortly after invading Ukraine in 2022, may want to add credibility to the repeated warnings. According to the Telegram channel Rybar, close to the Russian military, “Russia’s latest warnings, like its red lines, are taken less and less seriously. In the face of this, the adversary is reducing Russia’s room for manoeuvre.”\n\nIf you were running Russia, what would you do if Ukraine was being used as a launchpad for long-range western missiles that were targeting your cities?\n\nYou would probably issue very strong warnings at first, but if those warnings had no effect you would eventually be forced to take action.\n\nOminously, it is being reported that Vladimir Putin has “mysteriously disappeared from public view” since November 7th…\n\nVladimir Putin has mysteriously disappeared from public view as his regime issued apocalyptic World War Three nuclear threats over the use of long-range Western missiles by Ukraine against Russian territory. It is unclear if during the past 12 days of high international tension the Kremlin dictator has been holed up in a hi-tech bunker, unwell, underwent another round of plastic surgery, took a secret holiday or simply chose to remain out of sight. Yet Putin, 72, has not been definitively seen since an appearance at the Valdai Forum in Sochi on November 7 when he congratulated a “courageous” Donald Trump on his election victory and hinted he was ready for talks to end the war in Ukraine, according to the Faridaily Telegram channel, which monitors his movements and appearances.\n\nThe good news is that I do not believe that a full-blown nuclear showdown with the Russians is going to happen right away.\n\nIt appears that the Russians consider Donald Trump to be the final hope for peace, and so I think that they will delay doing anything drastic until they can negotiate with him.\n\nDonald Trump has said that he wants to end the conflict in Ukraine, but he also doesn’t intend to just give the Russians everything that they want.\n\nMeanwhile, our European allies, most members of Congress, and even some members of his own cabinet will be strongly urging Trump to continue fighting the Russians.\n\nSo we shall see what happens.\n\nIf the Russians ultimately conclude that they can’t reach an agreement with the Trump administration, all bets are off.\n\nTrump really will be holding the future of our society in his hands, and so let us hope that he makes the right decisions.\n\nMichael’s new book entitled “Why” is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com, and you can subscribe to his Substack newsletter at michaeltsnyder.substack.com.\n\nAbout the Author: Michael Snyder’s new book entitled “Why” is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com.

        "content": "Exploring AI’s deepening role in modern supercomputing — Nvidia, Weka and Run:ai weigh in\nThe real-world application of artificial intelligence to solve age-old problems across various technology sectors proves that AI is no longer just a buzzword. It’s a transformative force with real-world implications. A blossoming arena witnessing that transformation is supercomputing, and new AI infrastructure developments and nifty ecosystem partnerships highlight the innovation underway.\n“We created this reference architecture called Weka AI RAG Reference Platform,” said Shimon Ben-David (pictured, second from left), chief technology officer of WekaIO Inc. “Weka is a high-performance data platform … we are seeing customers still struggling with how to implement RAG inferencing. It has a lot of moving components. Honestly, there’s no real blueprint or protocols defined yet for that. We created this environment that shows all of the layers that are needed. We’re heavily using Run:ai and the Nvidia stack also, the GPUs, but also the software frameworks.”\nBen-David, alongside Ronen Dar (left), co-founder and chief technology officer of Runai Labs USA Inc., and Dion Harris (right), director of accelerated data center GTM at Nvidia Corp., spoke with theCUBE Research’s Savannah Peterson at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the three companies joining forces to create cutting-edge AI infrastructure solutions that are more than the sum of their parts. (* Disclosure below.)\nWeka’s WARRP redefines AI infrastructure\nWARRP has been designed to simplify the implementation of retrieval-augmented generation workflows. While RAG enables enterprises to customize AI models by integrating proprietary data, thus enhancing their relevance and utility, deploying these systems at scale has remained a significant challenge. Underpinned by Nvidia GPUs and Run:ai’s orchestration solutions, the platform provides fertile ground for enterprises to integrate and scale AI effortlessly, according to Harris.\nFor its part, Nvidia has long experimented with the AI idea, with evidence showing the company’s inroads as early as 2006 with foundational tools such as CUDA. Today, these tools are vital for enterprises as they transition from AI experimentation to large-scale deployment.\n“RAG is the way to customize foundational models to incorporate proprietary data or data that you care about and want to be represented in your AI models,” Harris said. “As it relates to Nvidia, we’ve been down this path of trying to be a proponent of AI and help customers adopt AI. [We’re] providing more guidelines, blueprints, templates and APIs that make it easy to plug and play and leverage these tools. Working with Weka and Run:ai is a great example of doing exactly just that.”\nRun:ai has emerged as a crucial player in optimizing AI workloads. As organizations deploy open-source large language models to maintain control over data, costs and intellectual property, the platform’s orchestration solutions ensure efficient scaling and GPU utilization. With an emphasis on “tokenomics,” or the economics of AI token production, Run:ai’s tools address the increasing demand for cost-effective and scalable AI operations, according to Dar.\n“When you scale your application, GPU utilization, the cost of those LLMs and the cost to serve those LLMs becomes a real problem,” he said. “As we all move forward and LLMs become more and more important, GPU utilization will become more and more important — just increasing GPU utilization and reducing the cost of serving LLMs.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: WekaIO Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

Dell Technologies Inc. aims to support customers in that journey.\n“People have been storing data for a long time and they have been doing what they felt was necessary,” said Geeta Vaghela (pictured), senior director of product management, Unstructured Data Solutions, at Dell. “But data management takes a lens beyond infrastructure into data. What is it and where are you using it and why does it matter? I don’t know that everyone’s been doing that. There’s a section of the market who are … starting with a clean sheet of paper.”\nVaghela spoke with theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante and Savannah Peterson at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed Dell’s history with data storage and current trends in the industry. (* Disclosure below.)\nHow AI is changing data management\nAdding to the complexities of setting up a modern data storage infrastructure are security requirements and government regulations. The Dell Data Lakehouse is one of several solutions the company offers for data-intensive AI workloads.\n“There’s compliance and governance and all these things that many organizations, the government, have to comply to,” Vaghela explained. “I think we’re just now starting to scratch the surface on what does that mean? And how do you quickly get yourself ready so that you’ve got the data, these GPUs that are either on their way to you or have been delivered. It’s a really, really interesting time where people are asking hard questions about storage and data management.”\nDell also announced the Dell AI Factory with Nvidia Corp., with the goal of driving AI innovation and productivity. The portfolio of solutions allows customers to extract metadata about their organization and produce accurate AI models.\n“Your metadata comes from one engine,” Vaghela said. “The biggest thing that I’m seeing is how do we use a selection of toolsets and bring them together such that we’re providing a full workflow … but also do it in a way that the sum total gives a repeatable model that many of these companies can stand behind because otherwise we get into hallucinations.”\nAlthough there are a variety of vertical trends for AI applications, including life sciences and autonomous driving, many of the challenges are the same, according to Vaghela. Dell offers additional AI implementation services to its customers, especially those just getting into data management.\n“What Dell does is we validate those solutions, we’ve got a point of view on where the strengths are, what to consider,” she said. “And for those that are early in the journey, there’s professional service opportunities.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: Dell Technologies Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "Google Cloud introduces AI agent ecosystem program\nGoogle LLC today introduced a new ecosystem program designed to help partners build artificial intelligence agents on its cloud platform.\nThe company will also help partners sell the agents they develop. To that end, it’s adding a new product section to the Google Cloud Marketplace.\nAI agents are large language models customized to perform a specific set of tasks. Developers can turn an LLM into an agent by giving it access to a dataset, such as a list of product descriptions, and configuring the model to incorporate the information into its output. Some agents are also equipped with system prompts that customize details such as the style of prompt responses.\nAccording to Google Cloud, its new ecosystem program will make it easier for partners to build AI agents on its platform. Companies that sign up will receive access to technical guidance from the search giant’s product and engineering teams. Google staffers can, for example, provide pointers on how to optimize an AI agent’s performance.\nThe company also plans to offer other technical resources. Google Cloud says that partners will receive dedicated support, best practices and early access to new AI technologies. That last perk could help participants more quickly develop products that incorporate the cloud platform’s latest features.\nThe new ecosystem program also has a go-to-market component. Google will provide “go-to-market programs and co-selling opportunities,” Kevin Ichhpurani, the president of Google Cloud’s global partner organization, detailed today. Marketing support will be provided in the form of promotional blog posts, events and related resources.\nGoogle Cloud is also updating Google Cloud Marketplace as part of the initiative. A newly added section called AI Agent Space now showcases relevant AI products from partners.\nOn launch, AI Agent Space includes more than a dozen offerings. One listing is from Typeface Inc., a venture-backed startup with an AI platform for creating marketing materials. It offers an agent that analyzes customer feedback and past campaigns to find ways of improving a company’s promotions.\nAnalytics provider ThoughtSpot Inc., meanwhile, offers a tool called Spotter. It’s an AI agent that debuted earlier this month and promises to help the company’s customers more quickly scan their business data for useful patterns. Spotter makes it possible to run analyses using natural language prompts.\n“AI Agent Space is available today with solutions from select partners, and we plan to add hundreds of additional AI agents over the coming months,” Ichhpurani detailed.\nAI agents are also a major focus for Google rival Microsoft Corp. at the Ignite developer event it’s hosting this week. On Monday, a Microsoft executive stated that the company has the “largest enterprise AI agent ecosystem.” More than 100,000 organizations have used the tech giant’s Copilot Studio service to create or edit AI agents.\nMicrosoft debuted several new features for Copilot Studio at Ignite. Most notably, customers can now create agents using the more than 1,800 prepackaged LLMs available in Azure. Microsoft also added enhancements that will make it easier for agents to incorporate data from external sources into their prompt responses.\nGoogle Cloud offers its own tool for creating AI agents. Vertex AI Agent Builder debuted in April and enables users to create agents with either code or natural language instructions.\nImage: Google\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Collaboration between Dell, Broadcom and Denvr focuses on AI factories of tomorrow\nWhat does artificial intelligence or AI factories of the future look like?\nThat is the question Denvr Dataworks Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. aim to answer with their combined computing and cooling hardware. AI requires a massive amount of compute, so power and efficiency are key for the construction of modern data centers.\n“We all know that everybody’s running out of data center power and space,” said Vaishali Ghiya (pictured, right), executive officer of global ecosystems and partnerships at Denvr Dataworks. “AI workloads are very power-hungry. So, that is exactly why we designed our Denvr Dataworks private zone, in partnership with Broadcom and Dell, so that we can give customers different choices and options, as well as open architecture. Liquid immersion cooling, as well as liquid to the chip cooling, really results in the efficient power usage as well as a compact footprint.”\nGhiya; Hasan Siraj (left), head of software products, ecosystem, at Broadcom; and Arun Narayanan, senior vice president of compute and networking product management at Dell, spoke with theCUBE Research’s John Furrier at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed what is next for AI factories and networking. (* Disclosure below.)\nCreating modular and efficient AI factories\nDenvr has created modular superclusters, which can house more than 1,000 GPUs in less than 900 square feet, and use liquid immersion cooling as part of an effort to house larger AI workloads. The goal is to build the most efficient rack infrastructure, according to Narayanan.\n“The Dell-Broadcom partnership is about open systems,” he said. “We believe ethernet will be the technology of choice for AI networking. We want to be time-to-market, first-to-market, but we want interoperability. You buy an asset today, you want that asset to live for 18 months to 24 months. The next asset comes along, it has to be interoperable.”\nBroadcom recently released the Tomahawk 5, a class of Ethernet switching devices, as well as linear drive optics, which remove the digital signal processor’s less electrical components. Both Broadcom and Dell see ethernet as the future of AI networking.\n“We’ll see the scale become bigger and bigger over the next four years, but we’ll also see this go down to other verticals,” Siraj said. “We will see enterprise adopters … and from a networking perspective, we believe ethernet will win. It’s already on its way, and it can scale from the largest clusters on the planet to whatever optimizations that are required for inference and other use cases.”\nEqually important to the construction of an efficient computing structure and network is the software layer, according to Ghiya. Denvr focuses on working backward from its customers’ business goals to create a complete computing stack that meets their needs.\n“We create a full software AI stack on top of [what Dell and Broadcom provide],” she said. “So, starting from the optimizing of the data center for power cooling and space, then layering the networking and storage fabric on top of it, which is based on the open standards. Then doing platform orchestration, which is based on Kubernetes … and then providing rest APIs to the customer to bring that AI workloads to address their key business outcomes.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: Dell Technologies Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "Decentralized AI infrastructure emerges as a sustainable alternative for enterprises\nTechnology is seeing a seismic shift, driven in part by artificial intelligence, with AI compute solutions emerging as the backbone of this growth.\nAs the demand for accessible, energy-efficient and flexible infrastructure skyrockets, industry leaders are embracing decentralization, sustainability and multi-vendor ecosystems. This approach challenges traditional hardware dominance, fostering collaboration across platforms to spark innovation and reduce dependency on singular providers, according to Saurabh Kapoor (pictured, left), director of product management and strategy at Dell Technologies Inc.\n“Open is the future … innovation and collaboration. You create that ecosystem and let everybody contribute and build on it,” Kapoor said.\nKapoor and Jon Stevens (right), chief executive officer of Hot Aisle Inc., spoke with theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante and Savannah Peterson at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the Dell and Hot Aisle partnership, the transformative impact of AI on technology infrastructure, and the rise of sustainable and decentralized AI compute solutions. (* Disclosure below.)\nBuilding sustainable and decentralized infrastructure using AI compute solutions\nAMD-powered infrastructure has become a viable alternative in the AI space, Stevens said, as he talked about his journey from large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations to spearheading AI-focused compute solutions. By leveraging AMD’s M1300X GPUs, Hot Aisle has established a groundbreaking compute model that offers developers remote access to high-performance resources while promoting energy sustainability in green-powered data centers.\n“The thing that I think that we’re going to focus on is just continuously releasing whatever’s [the] latest and greatest, working with Dell, working with AMD, working with Broadcom to continuously make this latest and greatest hardware available to developers, to anyone, and support them with that,” Stevens said.\nThis shift aligns with a broader industry push toward decentralization and flexibility in AI infrastructure. The emphasis on multi-vendor ecosystems challenges Nvidia Corp.’s dominance in the space, providing enterprises with a much-needed alternative for critical workloads, according to Stevens.\n“Nvidia’s done a fantastic job. They are number one for a reason,” he said. “Their hardware and software is unparalleled. But in the grander scheme of AI and the safety of AI, we talk about sovereign AI quite a bit. The source of the data that we’re putting into AI affects what comes out at the end of the day. It comes all the way down to the hardware. We need to have multiple solutions available for people.”\nHot Aisle’s collaboration with Dell has been pivotal in this effort, enabling tailored solutions for enterprises seeking to optimize AI workloads. The partnership exemplifies how forward-thinking companies are focusing on simplifying the adoption of AI infrastructure. From training to inferencing, these solutions cater to a range of applications, from computational fluid dynamics to high-frequency trading.\n“It’s all about building the right partnerships for [the] future,” Kapoor said. “The AI thing is real now. You’re building infrastructures that are going to be fundamental build blocks for the future as well. As things evolve, every ecosystem, the end consumer from enterprises like healthcare and financial services, like AI, is going to expand very quickly over the next few months and years. We are building infrastructures that are able to support the future.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: Dell Technologies Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "From servers to clusters: theCUBE takes a look at how Broadcom is using AI to reshape IT infrastructure\nClustered systems are emerging as the backbone of artificial intelligence infrastructure, transforming how industries manage the immense demands of training large language models and executing machine learning tasks.\nAs traditional computing frameworks fall short, these interconnected networks of servers are driving a new era of efficiency and scalability. However, the success of these systems hinges on strong networking solutions, which serve as the critical foundation for ensuring seamless operations and unlocking AI’s full potential. Without such innovations, even the most advanced AI systems risk falling short of their promise, according to Hasan Siraj (pictured), head of software products, ecosystem, at Broadcom Inc.\n“There [are] people who know how to manage Ethernet-based networks,” Siraj said. “There are troubleshooting tools, monitoring tools that are available. Whenever you’re building an AI network, you have a front end, a backend, a storage and an outband management network that’s all Ethernet. It’s a standard way of managing all of it.”\nSiraj spoke with theCUBE Research’s John Furrier and Dave Vellante at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed how Broadcom is using clustered systems and advanced networking solutions to change AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of training large language models and executing machine learning tasks. (* Disclosure below.)\nAI-driven networking as the backbone of clustered systems\nBroadcom is playing a leading role in enabling next-generation clustered systems, particularly for hyperscalers building massive AI-driven infrastructures. Networking, though often overlooked, is pivotal in connecting thousands — potentially millions — of GPUs across clusters, according to Siraj.\n“If you are training a large model and these models are growing at an exponential, they don’t fit in a CPU, and a core of a CPU, virtualization is no play,” he explained. “This is why you cannot fit a model within a server or two servers or four servers. That is why you need a cluster. When you have a cluster and everything is spread out, you need glue to put this all together. That is networking.”\nNetworking in this context is not merely a cost center but the linchpin of operational success. If the network falters — whether through latency, bandwidth limitations or failure to recover from hardware faults — the entire AI training process can be compromised, leading to costly inefficiencies and delays, Siraj said.\n“Ethernet is now becoming kind of the defacto standard for the scale out network,” he explained. “There are the largest clusters out there, a hundred thousand GPUs, which are based on this meta. Predominantly the world is moving there. You need to be able to cater to very small packets at very high throughput. You need to have what we call linked level retries. You need to be able to optimize the headers to utilize the bandwidth effectively.”\nBroadcom is innovating across multiple levels of the technology stack, from network silicon and systems to software optimizations. These developments ensure that AI clusters can keep pace with the exponential growth in data and computational requirements, Siraj added.\n“You’ve got to innovate at all levels of the stack,” he said. “We build up network silicon, we’ve got to do a lot of innovation there. There’s innovation on the system level, the innovation that needs to happen on the software side.”\nThe AI revolution demands a rethink of traditional IT architectures, with networking emerging as the keystone for enabling cutting-edge clustered systems. As companies such as Broadcom push the boundaries of what networking can achieve, the promise of democratizing supercomputing capabilities for AI is becoming a tangible reality, driving advancements that will define the future of technology.\nThe [Remote Direct Memory Access] was useful in InfiniBand, but if you want to go to this bigger scale you need to be able to fix it,” Siraj said. “You need to bring multipathing to your point out of our replacement, selectively transmit. People are standardizing on these kind of implementations. People have a standard implementation which can allow them to scale down the road no matter what size clusters they’ve gotten.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for SC24.

Intel hasn’t officially introduced the N150 processor yet, but according to recent leaks it should bring a modest boost in CPU and graphics performance over the Intel N100.\n\nThe first mini PC maker to introduce a product with an Intel N150 processor was Asus: the upcoming Asus NUC 14 Essential is a mini PC with support for Intel N150, N250, or Core 3-N355 processor options.\n\nThose chips are expected to bring modest spec bumps over the Intel N100, N200, and Core i3-N305, respectively. And while it’s unclear if there are any significant architectural changes, the Beelink EQ14 will feature an Intel N150 quad-core processor with support for CPU frequencies up to 200 MHz higher than those supported by the N100, and Intel integrated graphics with support for GPU speeds up to 250 MHz faster than the Intel N100.\n\nOther features include a plastic body with a fan and heat sin for active and passive cooling, a single SODIMM slot for DDR4 memory, and two M.2 2280 slots for storage: one with PCIe 3.0 x4 support and another with PCIe 3.0 x1 support.\n\nLike the Beelink EQ13 that launched earlier this year, the EQ14 features an integrated power supply, which means that you don’t need an external power brick or adapter – you just need to run a power cord from the back of the computer to an AC outlet.\n\nOther features include USB Type-C and Type-A ports, a headphone jack, and what appear to be at least two dedicated video outputs. Beelink hasn’t added information about the upcoming EQ14 mini PC to its website yet, but according to pictures shared on social media by @realVictor_M (1)(2), the computer will be pretty cheap when it launches soon in China, with prices for a barebones model (without any memory, storage, or operating system) starting as low as 599 CNY ($83).\n\nvia wccftech\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

        "content": "Observability in the AI age: Microsoft and Dynatrace team up to combat modern enterprise challenges\nArtificial intelligence has reshaped how companies serve products, interact with customers, market themselves and measure performance. The technology is also revamping data visibility, with AI-powered observability deployed to glean deep-lying insights from data resources spread across disparate cloud deployments.\nVisibility is key to business resilience, and resilience is key to business success. Dynatrace LLC and Microsoft Corp. have combined cutting-edge AI tools and robust cloud infrastructure to deliver AI-powered observability, driving the expedient discovery and remediation of multimodal data issues.\n“Our SaaS offering is running on Azure, providing our customers a native experience to have observability available from Dynatrace as they’re using their cloud environments,” said Alois Reitbauer (pictured, left), chief technology strategist of Dynatrace LLC. “What we provide is observability and security for their more traditional workloads in addition to their AI workloads with AI observability. Obviously, it’s also key to have a partner like Microsoft and the cloud infrastructure that allows to do this in a very automated way.”\nReitbauer and Eve Psalti (right), senior director of AI at Microsoft Corp., spoke with theCUBE Research’s Rob Strechay, during an exclusive CUBE Conversation, focused on “Next-Gen Observability to Ensure Business Resiliency.” They discussed AI-powered observability as a competitive advantage for enterprises navigating modern cloud challenges. (* Disclosure below.)\nAI-powered observability expands the cloud transformation horizon\nObservability, the practice of monitoring and analyzing systems to detect anomalies and optimize performance, is vital for AI-driven applications. For enterprises leveraging AI and cloud technologies, observability offers critical insights into infrastructure and application behavior, according to Psalti.\n“We’re saying that you don’t know what you can’t see,” she said. “Basically, observability becomes a critical factor in helping customers optimize their infrastructure and applications. It provides visibility into the behavior and the performance of the AI models. It also helps identify shifts in data patterns — what we call data detection. It helps identify root cause analysis for failure, and it’s a resource to further optimize your infrastructure by monitoring usage and identifying any patterns that you need to.”\nWhen paired with cloud-native capabilities, observability becomes a tool for troubleshooting as well as innovation, enabling businesses to deliver better customer experiences and achieve faster time-to-market.\nFor Microsoft, the alliance with Dynatrace transforms Azure’s powerful AI and cloud capabilities into actionable business value. By embedding Dynatrace’s observability tools into Azure, enterprises gain a comprehensive view of their systems. This synergy allows companies to harness advanced insights, ensuring applications are secure, reliable and scalable, Psalti added.\n“We are building the platform, whether it’s at the cloud base or with the AI capabilities that we bring in,” she said. “We depend on partners like Dynatrace to activate the business value. We know that getting advanced insights and security insights is top-of-mind for customers. Having a deep and robust observability platform on top of your cloud and AI infrastructure is absolutely key.”\nNavigating the complexities of AI and cloud-native environments\nAI and cloud technologies are reshaping enterprise operations. Modern digital-first processes, such as automated customer interactions, require increasingly complex backend systems. These systems consist of myriad interconnected services and microservices that must operate seamlessly.\nTrends such as gen AI add another layer of complexity. Applications leveraging AI models, from language generation to predictive analytics, require real-time monitoring to ensure performance and prevent downtime, according to Reitbauer.\n“We can’t afford downtime anymore, and we are constantly introducing new technologies like generative AI, for example,” he said. “These environments have become more complex and harder to manage. Applying very traditional approaches to manage those applications would not work. That’s how observability and also AI observability comes into play, really supporting the people who have to keep these applications that allow these modern experiences to be available for customers.”\nDynatrace’s proprietary hypermodal AI model, known as Davis, exemplifies the fusion of advanced AI techniques to tackle enterprise challenges. Davis integrates predictive AI, causal AI and generative AI to deliver holistic system management, according to Reitbauer.\n“The idea is to combine multiple forms of AI to provide the best outcome,” he said. “It starts on the predictive side, understanding how a system should behave. And when it’s not behaving as it’s expected to, this is usually referred to as anomaly detection.”\nPredictive AI anticipates system changes, while causal AI determines the relationships between events. Gen AI, powered by robust data inputs, suggests specific actions, such as modifying deployment scripts or resolving user-facing issues.\nHere’s theCUBE’s complete video interview with Reitbauer and Psalti:\n(* Disclosure: Dynatrace LLC and Microsoft Corp. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

Apple has already released software patches for the flaws, which is why the second thing admins realized is that they must rush through any necessary software verification process required before expediting installation of the update.\n\nIn these days of remotely managed devices and increasingly effective MDM systems, that’s far less a problem than it was in the past. You can usually make a policy change and push out updates to all your managed devices quickly.\n\nCompanies that don’t use these systems, or those that have employees using their own personal devices to access potentially sensitive internal data, must work harder to convince users to install security updates. So, what can they tell people about the latest threat that might help motivate them to install the patch today?",

        "content": "While the industry anticipates the launch of its next-gen dedicated Gaudi 3 ASICs followed by Falcon Shores, both pushed into 2025; Intel has already revealed Jaguar Shores as the next successor in this lineup, per HPCwire. However, we aren't sure if Jaguar Shores will combine the CPU and GPU into a single platform, as was initially planned with Falcon Shores.\n\n, The report says that Intel's Habana Labs division - probably unintentionally - revealed this codename during a technical workshop at the SC2024 conference. When I inquired for more details, Intel refused to comment, but that's expected since most specifications are likely not finalized by now.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Intel's current lineup includes dedicated ASICs termed \"Gaudi,\" whose third iteration - Gaudi 3 - has been pushed back to 2025 and competes against Nvidia's last-gen Hopper-based H100. Intel's HPC and AI GPUs are side by side, and Ponte Vecchio currently sits in the world's third-fastest supercomputer, Aurora.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel merged these two families into a disaggregated XPU (CPU+GPU) codenamed \"Falcon Shores\" to further streamline its AI offerings. However, those plans have been axed, and Falcon Shores will arrive in a GPU-only configuration by late 2025. With that context in mind, we cannot say much about the design choices behind the upcoming Jaguar Shores.\n\nJaguar Shores is likely a GPGPU (General-Purpose GPU)—akin to Nvidia's B100, B200, and B300 chips—fabbed using an Angstrom-grade node (Intel 18A/14A). HPCwire suggests that Intel teased a Falcon Shores successor last year, slated for a 2026 launch. But will it be able to compete against Nvidia's Rubin chips by then?\n\nAdmittedly, Intel's AI accelerators pale in contrast to AMD and Nvidia, and the future of AI in the company still looks bleak. The data center is the bread and butter of Intel's financials. This likely influenced its decision to reserve an X3D-esque server cache even though Intel Foundry is more than capable of manufacturing it for the mainstream market. But not all is doom and gloom since the latest Granite Rapids CPUs with upwards of 128-core signal a potential resurgence for Intel, at least in servers and workstations.",
        "summary": "Intel is preparing to launch its next-generation Gaudi 3 ASICs and Falcon Shores, both delayed until 2025, with Jaguar Shores announced as a successor, though details about its CPU and GPU integration remain unclear. The codename \"Jaguar Shores\" was inadvertently revealed by Intel's Habana Labs during a technical workshop, but Intel has not provided further details, likely because specifications are not yet finalized. Intel's current lineup includes Gaudi ASICs, with Gaudi 3 competing against Nvidia's H100, and its HPC and AI GPUs are used in supercomputers like Aurora. Plans for Falcon Shores to combine CPU and GPU have been scrapped, and it will now be a GPU-only product by late 2025, while Jaguar Shores is expected to be a GPGPU using advanced fabrication technology. Despite challenges in AI accelerators compared to AMD and Nvidia, Intel's data center business remains strong, and new Granite Rapids CPUs suggest potential growth in servers and workstations.",

        "content": "Portuguese AI drone startup Tekever raises €70 million to expand operations\nTekever, a Portugal-based developer of an artificial intelligence-driven drone platform, today announced it has raised €70 million, or $74 million, in new funding to scale up production and expand its market reach, especially into the United States.\nThe Series B funding round was led by Baillie Gifford and backed by the NATO Innovation Fund, with participation from the U.K.-government-owned National Security Strategic Investment Fund, Crescent Cove Advisors LP, Iberis Simper and Cedrus Capital.\nBaille Gifford is known for backing companies such as Airbnb Inc., Spotify AB and SpaceX. In comparison, the NIF is a €1 billion bund launched in 2022 backed by 24 NATO allies to support early-stage startups and other venture capital funds developing dual-use emerging technologies critical to security and defense challenges.\nTekever provides what the company calls “intelligence-as-a-service” by delivering drone capabilities that can scan vast areas and share real-time data with a wide array of customers, including government, military and private companies. Applications of its technology include surveying for environmental issues such as oil spills, wildfires or flash floods and assisting with search and rescue missions for defense purposes.\nThe company’s platform has been deployed in Ukraine to contribute to long-range intelligence and reconnaissance.\nTekever differentiates itself from other drone platforms and aerospace companies by maintaining full control over every aspect of its drone platform — airframe design, manufacturing payloads, avionics, software, data and AI. The company said that allows it to adapt its platform capabilities rapidly to changing customer needs.\n“We’re living in a highly volatile world, experiencing exponential change and the transformative power of software, AI and robotics,” said Chief Executive Ricardo Mendes. “Tekever was built to embrace and leverage this reality, providing its customers with future-proofed, AI-centric hardware-enabled systems produced at scale and effectively delivered and sustained globally.”\nDrones built by the company include capabilities such as catapult and vertical takeoff-and-landing, or VTOL, with recovery methods that include traditional landing and parachute. The company has been working on building its largest drone ever, the ARX, which will have a maximum takeoff weight of 600 kilograms and incorporates advanced AI technologies.\nThis higher carry-weight will allow it to house a swarm of smaller drones that will use it as a “mother” drone, marking it as the first to do so in the company’s product line. The ARX will coordinate the swarm of small drones to perform complex missions while in the field using its AI capabilities.\nCustomers of Tekever include the European Maritime Safety Agency and the U.K. Home Office, as well as defense and security forces throughout Europe, North America and Southeast Asia.\nImage: Tekever\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Qualcomm has the bit between its teeth… The wireless chip giant has identified a diversified customer base and major growth opportunities that, it believes, will give it a total addressable market of $900bn by 2030, the company’s president and CEO, Cristiano Amon, stated at its 2024 investor day. “Qualcomm’s focus on diversification and [an] industry-leading technology roadmap has significantly strengthened the company’s growth profile,” said Amon. “As generative AI accelerates demand for our technology and we become increasingly relevant across multiple industries, Qualcomm is well positioned to address a $900bn opportunity by 2030 across an expanding ecosystem of new customers and partners.” The company’s new five-year targets include significant growth in the company’s annual automotive product line revenues, which Qualcomm believes will reach $8bn by its financial year 2029: In its 2024 fiscal year, which ended in September, the automotive product line generated revenues of $2.91bn. Qualcomm also believes its annual internet of things (IoT) product revenues will reach $14bn by fiscal 2029, up from $5.42bn in fiscal 2024.

Earl Lum, president of EJL Wireless Research, shared his views in this LinkedIn post on Tuesday: Lum went into great detail to note the shortcomings of Nokia’s RAN gear (particularly related to its fan cooling) and to suggest that it will be hard for T-Mobile US, from an economic and technical point of view, to stick with Nokia as a major supplier, especially when Ericsson can deliver on the operator’s needs. “We have heard through our channel contacts that Nokia has begged and pleaded with T-Mobile USA and is willing to do whatever it takes to not lose the account,” wrote Lum. “But, the reality is that T-Mobile USA has been asking Nokia for 10+ years to do the things they have asked for and Nokia has been unable to deliver, time and time again. So what else can Nokia do? We believe that Ericsson’s macro and massive MIMO radio portfolio can deliver the virtualised, cloud, and AI RAN-driven solutions T-Mobile USA is looking for in the future with 5G-A.” Lum and his team believe that Ericsson has tabled a very financially and technically attractive offer and that T-Mobile US is going to shift to Ericsson as its dominant, possibly even sole, RAN equipment supplier and Lum is confident this will happen. He wrote: “In the end, MAYBE we are wrong (highly unlikely) and it will not happen and T-Mobile USA decides to pardon Nokia from death row at the 11th hour, but we believe that the single vendor Cloud/AI RAN Thanksgiving turkey dinner/offer with all of the fixings and unlimited open bar that Ericsson has prepared and put on the table may be too good of a deal to pass up.” The bad news for Nokia is that Lum/EJL Wireless Research has a track record at getting these calls right: Late last year, Lum published a post highlighting speculation that Nokia was about to be dropped from AT&T’s RAN plans and that’s exactly what happened only days later when AT&T announced a five-year, $14bn deal that made Ericsson the near exclusive RAN technology provider. It’s also worth remembering that Nokia was also dropped by Verizon in 2020 and replaced by Samsung Networks. The T-Mobile US statement to Bloomberg doesn’t say Lum’s post is inaccurate – it just says that it continues to work with both Nokia and Ericsson, a statement that has a lot of wiggle room. Nokia’s share price dipped following Lum’s blog but recovered slightly after T-Mobile US’s statement and currently stands at €4.07 on the Helsinki exchange. All eyes will be on T-Mobile US and Ericsson in the coming weeks.\n\nUS cable networks and media giant Comcast is spinning out its TV divisions, including CNBC and MSNBC, as an independent company (called, for now, SpinCo) that will be “an industry-leading news, sports and entertainment cable television business with a focused strategic direction… [providing] a diverse and differentiated content offering that will reach approximately 70 million US households,” and annual revenues of about $7bn, the company announced early Wednesday. Comcast will focus on, and invest in, its “strategic core growth businesses across its Content & Experiences and Connectivity & Platforms businesses, including residential broadband, wireless, business services, streaming, studios and theme parks.”\n\nChina Mobile has tabled a non-binding offer to acquire HKBN, the Hong Kong-based broadband network operator noted in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Wednesday. Previous reports, including this one from Bloomberg, suggested the value of the offer is in the region of $835m.\n\n– The staff, TelecomTV",

        "content": "It has been more than two and a half years since Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac, as part of its move away from Intel processors. Since then, the 24-inch iMac has been Apple's only all-in-one desktop computer, with no larger model available.\n\n\n\nWill a larger iMac ever make a comeback? We recap the latest rumors below.\n\nIn November 2023, Apple announced that it had no plans to release a new version of the 27-inch iMac with an Apple silicon chip. Instead, Apple recommended pairing its Studio Display external monitor with the Mac Studio or Mac mini.\n\nApple's statement ruled out a new 27-inch iMac, but an even larger model is still possible one day. Around a year ago, both Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple was developing a 32-inch iMac for release in late 2024 or in 2025. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen would feature mini-LED backlighting, which would allow for increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, and other benefits compared to LCD technology.\n\nWhile there haven't been any rumors lately about this alleged 32-inch iMac, Gurman said Apple was still exploring a larger iMac as recently as August this year.\n\n\"A larger iMac remains something Apple is exploring as well, but it's unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later,\" he wrote.\n\nThat is all that is known about a potential larger iMac at this point.\n\nAll in all, it seems that a larger iMac might be on Apple's roadmap, but the wait continues for now. In the meantime, Apple updated the 24-inch iMac with the M4 chip last month. Given that a larger iMac did not launch at the same time as the updated 24-inch iMac, the wait for one will very likely continue into 2025 or later, if it ever happens.",

You have to be able to analyze it, process it, gain insight from it and then deliver that insight to organizations who will then benefit from it. And we are at the core of it. We are the data intelligence platform that propels the growth of AI across industries and marketing.”\nBouzari spoke with theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante and John Furrier at SC24, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the game-changing impact of data intelligence in AI and how DDN fits into the equation. (* Disclosure below.)\nData intelligence as a stepping stone toward AI improvement\nData intelligence lies at the heart of DDN, making the acceleration of value creation an inherent process. This is because data intelligence not only streamlines processes by identifying inefficiencies and recommending solutions, but also facilitates AI optimization through data-backed insights, Bouzari pointed out.\n“We’re connecting the above the stack to the inside the stack, and that’s what data intelligence is,” he said. “It’s accelerating efficiency, reducing the footprint in the data center and in the cloud, accelerating the access and the insight of data and content above the stack. Many of the discussions we’re having with our customers who are in AI is, ‘How do we give you an order of magnitude better performance out of your analytics layer?’”\nFlexibility, scalability and customization are fundamental principles in data intelligence. This is because they are essential when creating robust and adaptable systems that meet diverse and evolving business needs, according to Bouzari.\n“The technology needs to adapt, absorb and amplify flexibility, in the data center, in the cloud,” he explained. “That’s why we spend more than a decade perfecting technology, which takes data intelligence, and delivers it, analyzes it, processes it anywhere at the snap of a finger. You have to curate the content, you have to ingest it, you have to train it and you have to deliberate. That’s the technology that DDN has developed.”\nThe deep interconnection between AI and high-performance computing is based on the fact that the latter acts as a foundation enabler for many AI advancements. As a result, DDN fosters this relationship by partnering with various players, such as Nvidia Corp., according to Bouzari.\n“The foundation for AI is in high-performance computing, because in high-performance computing, you have to solve problems at a massive scale,” he said. “You have to develop technology that maximizes efficiency at a massive scale in the data center. Well, AI is simply that, magnified and distributed. If you look at the leaders in the space, Nvidia started out in high-performance computing. Eight years later, we’re the only technology that is being used internally by Nvidia, or the only data intelligence platform, but the enabler was the pivot from high-performance computing into AI.”\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of SC24:\n(* Disclosure: DataDirect Networks Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

        "content": "Qualcomm had its annual investor day yesterday and with that comes news that the company expects to be selling no less than $4 billion in PC processors annually by 2029 (via CNBC).\n\nIf that sounds like a big number, it is. For context, AMD's most recent full-year earnings figures showed that it brought in $4.7 billion in sales for its \"client segment\" in the most recent quarter, which mostly comprises PC processors and excludes PC graphics cards and chips for consoles.\n\nAMD has admittedly upped its game since then, netting $1.9 billion in the last quarter alone for client PC sales. But Qualcomm's claims would very much put the company in the same ballpark as AMD for client PC processor sales. That would be some achievement, given Qualcomm was virtually starting from zero in the PC market when it launched the Snapdragon X earlier this year.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, reported nearly $30 billion in sales for its \"Client Computing Group\" in 2023. But that includes not only PC processors, but chips for motherboards, cellular modems, Wi-Fi controllers and more.\n\nYou'd still expect Qualcomm's $4 billion to be quite a bit smaller than whatever Intel is currently pulling in from just CPU sales. But however you slice it, Qualcomm is expecting to sell a very large number of its PC processors by 2029. And that means a very large number of Arm-based PCs, presumably mostly laptops, being bought by actual end users.\n\nFor now, it's very hard to say how well sales of laptops with Qualcomm Snapdragon X chips have been going. But one key question is whether Qualcomm's success would make for a larger market for PC processors overall, or could it be a zero sum affair, taking away sales from Intel, AMD or presumably both?\n\nThe likely reality is a bit of both. But the other imponderable is whether Qualcomm will even be making PC processors by 2029. Qualcomm and Arm are currently fighting it out in the courts over Qualcomm's very right to make CPUs based on Arm's instruction sets.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nArm has said it intends to cancel Qualcomm's licence to make Arm-based CPUs. But we suspect that even if Qualcomm loses the legal case, the result is more likely to be a larger licence fee to Arm than Qualcomm actually ceasing to make the chips.\n\nWhile all this is going on, we also have rumours that Nvidia is planning to enter the PC processor market, perhaps as soon as late 2025, with its own Arm-based chip. How that factors into Qualcomm's supposed $4 billion in annual PC processor sales isn't clear. But if Qualcomm is selling $4 billion worth and Nvidia is selling billion dollars more in PC processors, well, the market sure is going to be crowded.\n\nIn the meantime, we're really waiting to see if anyone can get PC games running reliably and consistently on an Arm CPU of any kind. Both Apple and Qualcomm have proved that Arm cores can be more than competitive with AMD and Intel's x86 CPU cores for raw performance. But software compatibility and particular game support remains the main stumbling block.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if big games publishers begin to release native Arm builds of their latest games any time soon. If PC gaming on Arm is to really take off, game support is going to be absolutely critical.",
        "summary": "Qualcomm announced during its annual investor day that it aims to generate $4 billion in annual PC processor sales by 2029, positioning itself alongside AMD in the client PC processor market. This ambitious target is notable given Qualcomm's recent entry into the PC market with the Snapdragon X, starting from virtually zero. While Intel's sales figures are significantly higher, they include a broader range of products beyond just PC processors. Qualcomm's potential success raises questions about whether it will expand the overall PC processor market or simply take market share from competitors like Intel and AMD. However, Qualcomm's future in the PC processor market is uncertain due to ongoing legal disputes with Arm over licensing rights, and the potential entry of Nvidia into the market could further complicate the landscape.",

        "content": "Generative AI drug discovery hub Converge Bio raises $5.5M to understand the ‘language of biology’\nDrug discovery startup Converge Bio Inc. said today it has closed on a $5.5 million seed round of funding to help biotech and pharmaceutical companies develop more effective drugs at faster speeds by leveraging generative artificial intelligence.\nThe startup has created a novel platform that employs advanced large language models trained on biological and chemical data, such as DNA, RNA and protein sequences and other types of molecular patterns. Its LLMs leverage that knowledge to discover and develop new kinds of drugs for all kinds of diseases and medical conditions.\nWhat Converge Bio wants to do is accelerate the drug discovery process, which has always been an extremely complex, expensive and time-consuming endeavor. As the startup points out, it takes about 10 years to develop new drugs and bring them to market, with costs often exceeding $1 billion. The expense means that a lot of promising drugs are never made, and the time it takes means that many people die while waiting for possible cures to be developed.\nOne of the biggest headaches in drug discovery is the failure rate, with more than 90% of candidate drugs failing to get past the clinical trial process, despite millions of dollars being spent on their development.\nIt’s this particular problem that Converge Bio says it can solve. Co-founder and Chief Executive Dov Gertz (pictured, center, alongside Chief Science Officer Iddo Weiner and Chief Technology Officer Oded Kalev), said generative AI has incredible potential to aid in drug discovery and development, and there are already dozens of examples of new medicines created with the technology currently undergoing clinical trials.\n“Biological languages, like DNA and RNA, aren’t just random sequences — they have intricate structures and rules, similar to the grammar and syntax of spoken languages,” he said.\nGenerative AI can help researchers to understand the language of DNA and RNA, and then use it to create new medicines.\n“Just like how ChatGPT can instantly generate a string of words to answer a question, a model trained on biological data can help rapidly design optimized mRNA sequences for vaccines, cutting months or years from the process,” Gertz promised.\nThe startup has created what it says is a “generative AI hub” that biotech and pharma companies can use to accelerate the discovery and development of new, DNA- and RNA-based drugs. It offers a library of foundational LLMs for all biological languages that can be customized and fine-tuned with additional data.\nIts models are designed to aid in the creation of very specific types of drugs, such as engineering antibodies with increased effectiveness and less side effects, or mRNA vaccines that are better optimized to elicit stronger immune responses. It also helps with small molecule optimization and the creation of novel proteins and new biomarkers.\nGertz said the drug discovery process starts with predicting biological outcomes, assessing how well a new medicine might work. The models provide explanations for its predictions in biological terms that scientists can understand, and this allows them to refine the drugs to create more optimized candidates that deliver better patient outcomes.\n“The models are pretrained on vast amounts of data, so they can create significant insights even from minimal fine-tuning data,” he said.\nBio Converge’s platform has already gotten the attention of a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., which makes generic drugs, as well as Compugen Ltd., which specializes in immuno-oncology therapeutics, and BiomX Inc., a company that develops customized phage therapies.\nTLV Partners was the only investor named in the round. Managing Partner Shahar Tzafrir said he likes to invest in startups with bold visions as a matter of course, but he was “blown away” by Converge Bio’s approach.\n“[It] integrates generative AI into the fabric of biology,” he said. “The concept of treating biological data as a language is transformative. It’s not just advancing drug discovery, but reshaping how we understand, explain and manipulate biology itself.”\nImages: Converge Bio\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Procore to add AI agents to its construction management software platform\nConstruction software firm Procore Technologies, Inc. today announced plans to release a set of artificial intelligence agents early next year that are tuned to enforcing project efficiency, improving safety, enhancing decision-making and streamlining workflows.\nAgents are based on Procore AI, a unified platform that combines generative AI with predictive analytics. They will aim to automate routine tasks, reduce manual workloads and surface insights that make construction projects faster and more efficient.\nAmong the specific tasks agents will tackle are complex processes such as managing requests for information, scheduling and submittals, which are documents or physical samples that a contractor provides to the project owner, architect or engineer for approval. RFIs can take days to complete and hundreds may be involved in large construction projects. Procore figures agents can cut completion times to hours.\nAn Agent Studio set to be released next year will enable users to customize agents to meet their unique project requirements without any coding, the company said.\nProcore, which reported more than $1.1 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year, “has a 10-year history of using AI in construction,” said Chief Product Officer Wyatt Jenkins. “We use natural language processing to extract information from documents and have been doing computer vision for a long time to track progress and safety issues on construction sites.”\nConstruction has typically been a low-tech market dominated by paper, but the business is right for advanced technology like digital twins, virtual reality, predictive planning and simulations.\nGrand View Research Inc. estimates the global construction and design software market will be $11 billion this year and grow more than 10% annually through 2030.\nBeyond bots and drones\nProcore already uses data capture techniques such as robots and drones to track construction progress and flag safety issues. “We have millions and millions of photos and videos of job sites,” Jenkins said. “We’ve got a rich history of computer vision, predictive analytics and natural language processing used throughout the platform.”\nOne popular feature uses computer vision to examine blueprints and computer models to figure out the exact number of parts that will be needed. Another scans images and videos to identify safety risks.\nLarge language models have kicked the use of AI up a notch in the industry, Jenkins said. “One of the most important things we do in construction is help people find answers to questions,” he said. “If you walk a job site, you’ll hear people asking about what’s in the contract and how long a footing should be in place. These are simple questions but the answer is buried in a construction document somewhere.”\nProcore introduced a copilot last year and expects agentic AI to take functionality to the next level. One popular agent in early testing notifies project managers are hidden scheduling risks. “Construction’s all about time and money,” Jenkins said.\nThe combination of predictive analytics and LLMs will enable agents to analyze large volumes of text and data to generate schedules, predict anomalies and proactively notify managers about developments that merit their attention.\n“An RFI agent can decide that a conversation should be headed in a particular direction and it’s not, so it gives recommendations to how we might resolve a problem based on other RFIs on similar projects,” he said.\nThe schedule agent can identify delays and automatically trigger notifications to affected contractors. “If there’s a schedule change that moves painting back a week, that might affect glazing, window dressing and other downstream trades,” Jenkins said. “The schedule agent will choose and notify all the parties involved.”\nHe said Procore is guarding against bias and hallucinations by citing source material in answers and applying human experts to validate responses.\nPhoto: Unsplash\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",

        "content": "Nvidia’s SC24 special address hints at a new era in computing and AI\nAs the world of high-performance computing is getting together this week in Atlanta for SC24, Nvidia Corp. held a “special address” to showcase the company’s vision for computing and artificial intelligence, with founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang leading the charge.\nJoined by Ian Buck, Nvidia’s vice president and general manager for hyperscale and high-performance computing, Huang (pictured) underscored Nvidia’s central role in transforming scientific research and industries through accelerated computing. The presentation also featured insights from Arvind Ramanathan of Argonne National Laboratory and David Keyes of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, adding depth to the discussion while emphasizing real-world applications.\nNvidia’s journey in supercomputing\nHuang opened the address by discussing the societal importance of supercomputing. “Supercomputers are among humanity’s most vital instruments, driving scientific breakthroughs and expanding the frontiers of knowledge,” he said, which also framed Nvidia’s journey in supercomputing.\nLooking back to the launch of CUDA in 2006, he highlighted how Nvidia reshaped computational science, drastically reducing computing costs by a million-fold. He described CUDA as “a computational microscope, a telescope, and a time machine” that empowers researchers to conduct work previously deemed impossible.\nHuang cited CUDAx libraries as the keys to this transformation, explaining that they act as “the engines of accelerated computing” in domains such as healthcare, telecommunications and manufacturing.\nHuang said these tools have broadened the applications of Nvidia’s hardware and fueled a virtuous cycle of adoption, partnerships and developer engagement. This foundation underscores a broader industry trend: Platforms matter as much as hardware. Companies competing in the HPC market must invest in comprehensive ecosystems that enable seamless integration across applications.\nThe platform approach has created a massive moat around Nvidia that should enable the company to remain the de facto standard in accelerated computing, including supercomputing and AI. The company makes excellent graphics processing units, but CUDA dramatically simplifies the process of building applications and services that leverage the underlying Nvidia technology. Many industry watchers are looking for one of the other silicon manufacturers to take a bite out of Nvidia, but CUDA keeps the company out front.\nPioneering the AI computing era with Blackwell\nAs expected, Huang discussed Nvidia’s Blackwell system, the company’s latest AI platform designed to meet the escalating demands of training and inference. He described it as “a giant virtual GPU with 1.44 AI exaFLOPs” that integrates multiple chip types into a liquid-cooled, energy-efficient system. With production facilities underway in the U.S., Mexico and Taiwan, Blackwell exemplifies what Huang called Nvidia’s “extreme co-design philosophy,” where every component is optimized to deliver peak performance.\nHuang didn’t hold back from discussing the implications of what Blackwell can enable. “AI will soon power humanoid robots capable of adapting and performing various tasks with minimal demonstration,” he predicted. He added that these developments will reshape industries like manufacturing and logistics, fueling productivity growth and job creation.\nNvidia’s vision reflects a broader shift in computing. AI is not just a tool but a transformative force. By scaling systems like Blackwell, Nvidia positions itself as a cornerstone of this transformation, pushing traditional CPU vendors to reconsider their strategies.\nI believe the AI industry is poised for a massive shift. During this time, technology will become ubiquitous and embedded into almost everything we use. In the early 1990s, Cisco predicted that the internet would change the way we “work, live, learn and play. “ AI will have a similar but bigger impact, and Nvidia will be the foundation of that.\nAccelerating science with AI\n“AI has arrived, and a new computing era has begun,” Huang declared as he turned to integrating AI into scientific workflows. He highlighted applications ranging from drug discovery to climate modeling, where AI accelerates simulations and real-time data analysis. Nvidia’s newly announced CuPyNumeric, a GPU-accelerated implementation of NumPy, enables researchers to scale Python-based projects across GPU clusters without rewriting code.\nBuck emphasized its impact, sharing that the LCLS X-ray laser team achieved “a sixfold speedup in data analysis, reducing workflow times from years to months.”\nBuck introduced Arvind Ramanathan of Argonne National Laboratory, who illustrated how this technology transforms protein design. Ramanathan’s team used Nvidia’s architectures to train multimodal AI models that integrate natural language and protein sequences.\n“We achieved nearly three exaFLOPs of mixed precision runs,” he said, calling the performance “unbelievable” in its ability to accelerate discovery. These advancements make AI indispensable in science, democratizing access to HPC tools and enabling breakthroughs at scales previously unimaginable.\nBuilding a sustainable computing future\nEnergy efficiency emerged as a recurring theme. Buck pointed out that while GPUs consume more power per server, they significantly reduce the total energy required to complete computations. He cited examples like the Texas Advanced Computing Center achieving “a 110x speedup and 6x better energy efficiency” using Nvidia’s Grace Hopper architecture.\nHuang also tied energy efficiency to broader challenges, emphasizing that AI-driven systems like Blackwell will help industries adapt to global problems such as climate change. This focus aligns with the growing demand for sustainable computing practices as energy costs rise and environmental concerns intensify.\nOne of the frustrations points I’ve had recently is that industry watchers call out AI as conflicting with sustainability. Though it’s true that AI infrastructure is power-hungry, it’s important to understand the alternative. One ChatGPT query might use significantly more power than a search but might return an answer faster.\nFor example, the PGA TOUR uses generative AI to compile information on players. Without it, it requires loading media guides, searching videos, and other tasks that can take days or weeks to complete compared to the few seconds it takes AI. If used correctly, next-gen infrastructure can be more sustainable than legacy technology.\nCollaboration and innovation driving HPC\nBuck noted key milestones from the broader HPC community, including the Test of Time Award honoring Ari Kaufman’s 2004 paper on GPU clusters. He said Kaufman’s work laid the foundation for today’s accelerated computing, which now powers more than 70% of the top 100 fastest supercomputers.\nDavid Keyes of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology added context with genomics and climate modeling examples. His team scaled genomic studies to simulate 13 million synthetic patients, enabling countries to conduct population-wide analyses.\n“We democratized genome-wide association studies,” he said, emphasizing the potential for intelligent health and agriculture applications.\nHe highlighted advancements in climate emulation, which reduced data processing from 100-kilometer to 3.5-kilometer resolution.\n“We brought the queryable distance down dramatically,” he said, demonstrating the practical benefits of Nvidia’s innovations. These achievements underscore the importance of partnerships between technology providers and researchers.\nSome final thoughts\nNvidia’s SC24 Special Address offered a compelling vision of how accelerated computing and AI will shape the future. As the industry navigates this new era, collaboration, transparency and sustainability will be critical to harnessing the transformative power of AI. Nvidia’s leadership in this space sets a high bar, challenging others to innovate and adapt in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nAs Huang put it: “Let’s build the future together.”\nZeus Kerravala is a principal analyst at ZK Research, a division of Kerravala Consulting.

        "content": "Google DeepMind’s AlphaQubit tackles quantum error detection with unprecedented accuracy\nGoogle DeepMind’s quantum research team says it’s using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to solve one of the biggest challenges that prevents them from building a reliable quantum computer – error correction.\nIn a paper published in the journal Nature, the Google DeepMind and Quantum AI teams introduced a new, AI-powered decoder system for quantum computers that can identify computing errors with unparalleled accuracy. Called AlphaQubit, it’s the result of a collaboration that brings together Google DeepMind’s expertise in machine learning with Google Quantum AI’s proficiency in quantum machines.\nIn the research paper, the authors explained that the ability to accurately detect quantum computing errors is critical for making reliable machines that can scale to tackle the world’s biggest computational challenges. It’s a key step that may one day pave the way to numerous scientific breakthroughs that classical computers will never be able to achieve.\nThe team explains that quantum computers have the potential to solve problems in a matter of minutes or hours that would take conventional computers years to do. However, one of the major roadblocks in bringing these next-generation systems online is that qubits, the quantum equivalent of traditional “bits,” are extremely unstable and prone to errors. What’s needed is a way to detect these errors, so users can rely on the results generated by quantum machines.\nThe instability of qubits stems from the way they rely on quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement to solve complex problems in fewer steps. Qubits can sift through vast numbers of possibilities using quantum inference to find solutions, but their natural state is extremely fragile. They can be disrupted all too easily, by microscopic defects in hardware, or even the slightest variation in heat, minuscule vibrations, electromagnetic interference or even cosmic rays.\nThat explains why existing quantum computers either run at temperatures close to absolute zero, or use novel technologies like lasers to manipulate ion-based qubits held in a vacuum, but while these techniques do help, they don’t completely solve the problem of instability.\nBy using quantum error correction systems, it’s possible to get around the instability problem by grouping multiple qubits into a single, logical qubit and performing regular consistency checks on them. It then becomes possible to identify logical qubits that deviate from the norm, and correct them when it happens.\nThe difficulty lies in spotting these errors, and that’s where AlphaQubit can help – Google DeepMind explains that it’s a neural network-based decoder that leverages the same transformer architecture that underpins many of today’s large language models. The team trained AlphaQubit on hundreds of consistency checks, so that it can correctly predict when a logical qubit starts behaving incorrectly.\nAs the researchers explained:\n“We began by training our model to decode the data from a set of 49 qubits inside a Sycamore quantum processor, the central computational unit of the quantum computer. To teach AlphaQubit the general decoding problem, we used a quantum simulator to generate hundreds of millions of examples across a variety of settings and error levels. Then we tuned AlphaQubit for a specific decoding task by giving it thousands of experimental samples from a particular Sycamore processor.”\nIn the researchers’ tests, AlphaQubit displayed incredible accuracy compared to existing quantum decoders, making 6% fewer errors than tensor network methods in the largest Sycamore experiments. While tensor networks are quite accurate themselves, the problem is that they’re extremely slow. AlphaQubit, on the other hand, can identify errors with more accuracy and at much greater speed, more than fast enough to scale up to handle real-world quantum computing operations.\nThe researchers said that today’s most powerful quantum computers can achieve only a small fraction of the computing power that the technology will eventually achieve, and so there’s a need to show that AlphaQubit can scale up dramatically. To ensure it can, the researchers trained it on data from simulated quantum systems of up to 241 qubits, which vastly exceeds the number available on Sycamore. Once again, AlphaQubit vastly outperformed existing decoders, indicating it will be able to work with midsized quantum machines in the future.\nAlphaQubit has some other useful features too. For instance, it has the ability to report “condence levels” on inputs and outputs, which means there’s lots of potential to improve the performance of quantum processors in future. Moreover, when trained on samples of up to 25 rounds of error correction, the system maintained its high performance for up to 100,000 rounds, meaning it can generalize scenarios far exceeding its training data.\nAlthough AlphaQubit can help improve the reliability of quantum computers, the researchers conceded that there’s a lot of work ahead. For one thing, the system remains too slow to correct errors on a fast superconducting quantum processor in real time.\nAnd as quantum machines grow in size to exceed the millions of qubits necessary to achieve an advantage over classical computers, they’ll need to come up with more efficient ways of training the decoder to handle such a large number.\nImages: Google DeepMind\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU",
